    "text": "Why do software engineering skills matter to researchers?\nResearch computing competency and specifically programming skills are becoming ever more important in our data-driven world: Jacobs et al. (2016) argues that “we are rapidly approaching a point where innovations [in research] will primarily come from those who are able to translate an idea into an algorithm, and then into computer code.”\nResearch software engineering skills are the lab tools and competencies of the computational research world; much like practical lab safety training, researchers often pick up bad habits (ask me about my fear of HF acid). Also similarly to lab processes, procedures, and best practises, software engineering is awash with bizarre jargon and is very difficult to navigate without the support of a jaded old PhD student who has made every mistake imaginable (hello, it’s me, I escaped my PhD over a year ago now).\nThis course does not provide the holy grail, the singular correct way of doing things; instead, it should hopefully make the process of writing good, robust, reproducible code a little bit more straighforward.",

    "text": "How to use this resource\nThere’s a lot of materal here to absorb, so here are some guidelines to help you make the most of it. This material is also covered in the presentation linked below.\nLaunch fullscreen presentation ⤢ \n\n1. Use the PRIMM method where possible\nThe PRIMM method is a method to specifically learn a programming language (Sentance, Waite, and Kallia 2019), but is generally useful for learning computational commands etc. It’s helpful for you as a learner to understand the PRIMM structure so you can apply it while working through this course. Not every step will be relevant or used at every stage of the course!\n\nWhat’s PRIMM?PRIMM\n\n\nPRIMM is a pedagogical method specifically aimed at teaching text-based programming. While research into adult programming learners is very limited (especially in terms of demographics; many key studies that are cited have overwhelmingly homogenous test groups), the PRIMM method has a few key benefits:\n\nIt supports learners with different ability levels and who learn at different speeds;\nIt can be applied by learners even if the course materials are not specifically built with it in mind;\nIt can be applied to asynchronous learning materials (for example, if you are using these notes online on your own).\n\n\n\nThe P in PRIMM stands for predict:\nWhen you first see a command, script, or piece of code, before running it, predict what you think it will do. It’s ok to get this wrong: the important thing is to get into the habit of predicting! This helps to keep you actively engaged and focused, and begins to build an intuitive sense about the structure of commands.\n\nWhat do you think the code is going to do generally?\nWhat do you think the output in your terminal is going to look like?\n\n\n\nThe R in PRIMM stands for run:\n\nRun the code or program;\nHow does the output/effect compare to your prediction?\n\nWhat did you get right?\nWhat did you misinterpret?\n\nDo you understand what happened?\n\n\n\nThe I in PRIMM stands for investigate:\nLet’s dig a little deeper into the structure of code you’ve used.\n\nWhat options or arguments did you use, and what effect did they have?\nCan you find some documentation on the command you used?\n\nDoes the description match how you would describe the code?\n\nIf no, why does your understanding of it diverge?\n\nWhat other options or features are available?\n\n\n\n\nThe first M in PRIMM stands for modify:\n\nTry running the code with different options:\n\nChange only a small thing at a time;\nAlways predict what you think the output will be!\nCompare the actual output with your prediction;\nCompare your understanding to the available documentation.\n\n\nThis stage helps you to gradually increase the difficultly of the tasks you are doing!\n\n\nThe second M in PRIMM stands for make:\nThis stage is about making the code your own.\n\nAt this stage, you can try implementing snippets of code you’ve already learned, but to solve a new or different problem;\nAgain, use the previous stages when you are writing your code: predict what you think will happen, run the code and compare the output to your predictions, and investigate the structure of it, especially if it does not behave how you intended!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Kick back, relax, and do something else when you know something\nToo frequently, I have attended broad-level, apparently introductory courses that have catered to the fastest in the class.\nThe aim of this course is to demystify aspects of research software engineering, like dependency management, version control, and project directory structure. These topics are basic skills needed for pursuing research in the computational field. Certain demographics are less likely to learn these skills in an informal setting, meaning that classes like this are their main access to these topics.\nI am interested in helping the students who do not already know everything about these topics, and will not be pacing the course for the fastest in the group who have pre-existing knowledge. With that said, I know there is nothing more boring than sitting through a class where you already know all the material - please feel free to use this time to do extra reading, work on projects, do various administrative work; stick on headphones if you like, and join back in when something relevant comes up.\n\n\n3. Learn in a way that suits you\nRead before you write - research has proven repeatedly the importance of reading and predicting the output of code as a method of learning, over just getting straight into it and writing code.\n\nNovice programmers need to acquire accuracy in tracing code before they can program independently\nTrying to write code first leads to frustration and confusion\n\nHowever, with that said learn in a way that suits you - if that is copying and pasting commands from the slides instead of trying to keep up with typing, that’s ok! Also, if that means taking handwritten notes and not typing, that’s also fine!\nPlease feel free to:\n\nGet up and stretch when you need, leave for breaks, and stretch your eyes by looking away from the screen;\nWear headphones for background music if it helps you focus;\nKick off your shoes and sit comfortably;\nDo whatever else helps you learn!",
