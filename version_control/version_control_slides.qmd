## What is version control? 

::: {.incremental}
- Often described as "track changes", although that's not *quite* right
- A super-powerful "undo" button
- A way of working collaboratively without over-writing each other's work
- A way of [recording exactly what you did and when]{.extra}

![One way of doing version control...](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)

## What is version control?

- We're going to use `git`, which is a strangely named version control software
- We'll use this to explain how version control works, and why it matters
- There are lots of other ways to do version control, but `git` is very widely used
    - If *version control* was *word processing*, `git` would be *Microsoft Word*

## What does `git` do?

- `git` allows you to bundle up changes to various files, and give the group of changes a unique [commit hash]{.extra} and an explanatory message.
- `git` works on a project level, so you can make a bunch of changes to different files in a folder, and then [commit]{.extra} all those changes with a descriptive message
- It's recorded that *you* made those changes, and there's a unique [commit hash]{.extra} that you can quote to point at the exact state of your folder when you added those changes.
