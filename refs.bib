              planetary body could be source of both unmelted (chondritic) and
              melted (achondritic) meteorites. This dichotomy is a natural
              outcome of formation models assuming that planetesimal accretion
              occurred nearly instantaneously. However, it has recently been
              proposed that the accretion of many planetesimals lasted over ≳1
              million years (Ma). This could have resulted in partially
              differentiated internal structures, with individual bodies
              containing iron cores, achondritic silicate mantles, and
              chondritic crusts. This proposal can be tested by searching for a
              meteorite group containing evidence for these three layers. We
              combine synchrotron paleomagnetic analyses with thermal, impact,
              and collisional evolution models to show that the parent body of
              the enigmatic IIE iron meteorites was such a partially
              differentiated planetesimal. This implies that some chondrites and
              achondrites simultaneously coexisted on the same planetesimal,
              indicating that accretion was protracted and that apparently
              undifferentiated asteroids may contain melted interiors.",

               applied to evaluate the proposed impact histories of several

               sustained an impact that excavates to the depth required for

              inferences derive from only a few elements, none of which define
              rock type. We thus present the first estimates of rock types on
              exoplanets that once orbited polluted white dwarfs-stars whose

              planetary objects-examining cases where Mg, Si, Ca and Fe are

              formation. However, the silicate mantles of such exoplanets are
              discernable: one case is Earth like, but most are exotic in
              composition and mineralogy. Because these exoplanets exceed the

              mantle restites derived from a partially melted and incompletely

              ureilite parent body at 3.3±0.7 Ma after CAI formation postdated
              core formation in iron meteorite parent bodies by ∼2–3 Ma. Thermal
              modeling of planetesimal heating by 26Al-decay combined with the
              new Hf–W data indicates that the ureilite parent body accreted at
              ∼1.6 Ma after CAI formation and, therefore, more than ∼1 Ma later
              than iron meteorite parent bodies, but more than ∼0.5 Ma earlier

              remained incompletely differentiated even without exhaustion of
              26Al by silicate melt segregation. Our results show that both in
              terms of degree of differentiation and accretion timescale the

              and undifferentiated bodies, implying that there is an inverse

               tracked and studied in space for approximately 19 h before it
               impacted Earth's atmosphere, shattering at 44?36 km altitude. The
               recovered samples (>680 individual rocks) comprise the meteorite
               Almahata Sitta (AhS). Approximately 50?70\% of these are
               ureilites (ultramafic achondrites). The rest are chondrites,
               mainly enstatite, ordinary, and Rumuruti types. The goal of this
               work is to understand how fragments of so many different types of
               parent bodies became mixed in the same asteroid. Almahata Sitta
               has been classified as a polymict ureilite with an anomalously
               high component of foreign clasts. However, we calculate that the
               mass of fallen material was ≤0.1\% of the pre-atmospheric mass of
               the asteroid. Based on published data for the reflectance
               spectrum of the asteroid and laboratory spectra of the samples,
               we infer that the lost material was mostly ureilitic. Therefore,
               2008 TC3 probably contained only a few percent nonureilitic
               materials, similar to other polymict ureilites except less well
               consolidated. From available data for the AhS meteorite
               fragments, we conclude that 2008 TC3 samples essentially the same
               range of types of ureilitic and nonureilitic materials as other
               polymict ureilites. We therefore suggest that the immediate
               parent of 2008 TC3 was the immediate parent of all ureilitic
               material sampled on Earth. We trace critical stages in the
               evolution of that material through solar system history. Based on
               various types of new modeling and re-evaluation of published
               data, we propose the following scenario. (1) The ureilite parent
               body (UPB) accreted 0.5?0.6 Ma after formation of
               calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAI), beyond the ice line
               (outer asteroid belt). Differentiation began approximately 1 Ma
               after CAI. (2) The UPB was catastrophically disrupted by a major
               impact approximately 5 Ma after CAI, with selective subsets of
               the fragments reassembling into daughter bodies. (3) Either the
               UPB (before breakup), or one of its daughters (after breakup),
               migrated to the inner belt due to scattering by massive embryos.
               (4) One daughter (after forming in or migrating to the inner
               belt) became the parent of 2008 TC3. It developed a regolith,
               mostly ≥3.8 Ga ago. Clasts of enstatite, ordinary, and
               Rumuruti-type chondrites were implanted by low-velocity
               collisions. (5) Recently, the daughter was disrupted. Fragments
               were injected or drifted into Earth-crossing orbits. 2008 TC3
               comes from outer layers of regolith, other polymict ureilites
               from deeper regolith, and main group ureilites from the interior
               of this body. In contrast to other models that have been
               proposed, this model invokes a stochastic history to explain the
               unique diversity of foreign materials in 2008 TC3 and other
               polymict ureilites.",

              large monocrystalline diamonds (up to at least 100 µm),
              nanodiamonds, nanographite, and nanometric grains of metallic
              iron, cohenite, troilite, and likely schreibersite. The diamonds
              show a striking texture pseudomorphing inferred original graphite
              laths. The silicates in NWA 7983 record a high degree of shock
              metamorphism. The coexistence of large monocrystalline diamonds
              and nanodiamonds in a highly shocked ureilite can be explained by
              catalyzed transformation from graphite during an impact shock
              event characterized by peak pressures possibly as low as 15 GPa
              for relatively long duration (on the order of 4 to 5 s). The
              formation of ``large'' (as opposed to nano) diamond crystals could
              have been enhanced by the catalytic effect of metallic Fe-Ni-C
              liquid coexisting with graphite during this shock event. We found
              no evidence that formation of micrometer(s)-sized diamonds or
              associated Fe-S-P phases in ureilites require high static
              pressures and long growth times, which makes it unlikely that any
              of the diamonds in ureilites formed in bodies as large as Mars or

               considering potential habitability, complex organic molecules are
               relevant, key among which is methanol (CH3OH). Methanol primarily
               forms at low temperatures via the hydrogenation of CO ice on the
               surface of icy dust grains and is a necessary basis for the
               formation of more complex species such as amino acids and
               proteins. We report the detection of CH3OH in a disk around a
               young, luminous A-type star, HD 100546. This disk is warm and
               therefore does not host an abundant reservoir of CO ice. We argue
               that the CH3OH cannot form in situ, and hence that this disk has
               probably inherited complex-organic-molecule-rich ice from an

               framework allows us to characterise, quantify, and classify the

               endeavour is to generate a systematic method to study the
               arrangement and distribution of various planetary quantities
               within a single planetary system. We propose that the space of
               planetary system architectures be partitioned into four classes:
               similar, mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered. We applied our
               framework to observed and synthetic multi-planetary systems,
               thereby studying their architectures of mass, radius, density,
               core mass, and the core water mass fraction. We explored the
               relationships between a system’s (mass) architecture and other
               properties. Our work suggests that: (a) similar architectures are
               the most common outcome of planet formation; (b) internal
               structure and composition of planets shows a strong link with
               their system architecture; (c) most systems inherit their mass
               architecture from their core mass architecture; (d) most planets
               that started inside the ice line and formed in-situ are found in
               systems with a similar architecture; and (e) most anti-ordered
               systems are expected to be rich in wet planets, while most
               observed mass ordered systems are expected to have many dry
               planets. We find, in good agreement with theory, that
               observations are generally biased towards the discovery of
               systems whose density architectures are similar, mixed, or
               anti-ordered. This study probes novel questions and new parameter
               spaces for understanding theory and observations. Future studies
               may utilise our framework to not only constrain the knowledge of
               individual planets, but also the multi-faceted architecture of an
               entire planetary system. We also speculate on the role of system

               conductivity measurements at high temperatures and 1 GPa.
               Starting materials were powdered mixtures of peridotite KLB-1
               with various amounts (0, 3, 6, 13, 19, 24 vol.\%) of the 1 GPa
               eutectic composition in the Fe–FeS binary system. At temperatures
               above the eutectic point in the Fe–FeS system (∼980 °C) and below
               the solidus of KLB1 (∼1200 °C), molten Fe–S in a solid silicate
               matrix interconnects when the volume fraction is over ∼5\%.
               Conductivity–temperature paths indicate that in the presence of
               partial silicate melting the connectivity of molten Fe–S in a
               peridotite matrix is inhibited. Based on observations of
               retrieved samples, the percolation threshold of Fe–S melts in the
               presence of low to moderate degrees of silicate melt is estimated
               at 13±2 vol.\%. These results indicate that if the volume
               fraction of Fe-alloy in a planetesimal was initially greater than
               5\%, and if early heating by decay of radionuclides raised the
               temperature of the interior above the Fe-alloy melting point,
               initial metal segregation was controlled by permeable flow of
               molten iron alloy in a solid silicate matrix. These conditions
               were likely met by many terrestrial objects in the early solar
               nebula. Efficient removal of residual Fe-alloy (5 vol.\%) from
               silicate requires high-degree melting of silicate so that metal
               can segregate as droplets. Giant impacts during the final stage
               of accretion of large planetary objects could supply the energy
               required for high-degrees of melting. Alternatively, if initial
               metal segregation were delayed until a planetary object grew to
               large size (∼1000 km in diameter), release of gravitational
               potential energy due to metal segregation could contribute enough
               heat to form a magma ocean.",

               been performed on one olivine each from Emery and Pinnaroo and on
               an olivine separate from the Brenham pallasite. Nine olivines
               from Emery have a range of compositions from Fa18 to Fa28 and
               appear to come from a heterogenous source. This source was formed
               either by differing degrees of partial melting, yielding dunitic
               residues of variable composition or by fractional crystallization
               of one or more ultramafic magmas. Olivines from Mincy and
               Pinnaroo are more MgO-rich; Fa10 and Fa8 respectively. They
               require essentially total melting of a source composition that is
               rich enough in FeO to produce the basaltic clasts found in
               mesosiderites. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis
               that the mesosiderite olivines were formed in the outer few
               kilometers of their parent body. The range of mesosiderite
               olivine compositions completely overlaps the range of pallasite
               olivines. It is proposed that pallasite olivines also had a
               near-surface origin. A model is presented where external heating
               of a chondritic parent body yielded pallasites as a by-product of
               igneous differentiation. The olivine fraction was initially a
               dunitic residue from extensive partial melting or a cumulate
               dunite (solidus temperature ∼ 1600−1700°C) that was invaded by
               molten metal (solidus temperature ∼ 1500°C) from the upper
               portion of the parent body. The metal phase that was ultimately
               mixed with the dunite was probably the residual liquid after
               extensive fractional crystallization. The pallasites were formed
               where the dunite was cool enough to allow the metal to
               crystallize thereby preventing it from sinking further. This
               could have occurred in the outer few tens of kilometers of a
               102-km-sized asteroid.",

              the few fragments of olivine-dominated material in the main belt

               dichotomy between non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC)
               meteorites. However, the origin of this dichotomy—whether it
               results from processes within the solar protoplanetary disk or is
               an inherited heterogeneity from the solar system's parental
               molecular cloud—is not known. To evaluate the origin of the NC–CC
               dichotomy, we report Ni isotopic data for a comprehensive set of
               iron meteorites, with a special focus on groups that have not
               been analyzed before and belong to the CC group. The new Ni
               isotopic data demonstrate that the NC–CC dichotomy extends to Ni
               isotopes, and that CC meteorites are characterized by a
               ubiquitous 58Ni excess over NC meteorites. These data combined
               with prior observations reveal that, in general, the CC reservoir
               is characterized by an excess in nuclides produced in
               neutron-rich stellar environments, such as 50Ti, 54Cr, 58Ni, and
               r-process Mo isotopes. Because the NC–CC dichotomy exists for
               refractory (Ti, Mo) and non-refractory (Ni, Cr) elements, and is
               only evident for nuclides produced in specific, neutron-rich
               stellar environments, it neither reflects thermal processing of
               presolar carriers in the disk, nor the heterogeneous distribution
               of isotopically anomalous Ca–Al-rich inclusions (CAI). Instead,
               the NC–CC dichotomy reflects the distinct isotopic composition of
               later infalling material from the solar system's parental
               molecular cloud, which affected the inner and outer regions of
               the disk differently. Simple models of the infall process by
               themselves can support either infall of increasingly NC-like
               material onto an initially CC-like disk, or infall of
               increasingly CC-like material in the absence of disk evolution by
               spreading. However, provided that CAIs formed close to the Sun,
               followed by rapid outward transport, their isotopic composition
               likely reflects that of the earliest infalling material, implying
               that the composition of the inner disk (i.e., the NC reservoir)
               is dominated by later infalling material, whereas the outer disk
               (i.e., the CC reservoir) preserved a compositional signature of
               the earliest disk. The isotopic difference between the inner and
               outer disk was likely maintained through the rapid formation of
               Jupiter, which prevented complete homogenization between material
               from inside (NC reservoir) and outside (CC reservoir) its orbit.",

              growth of large solid cores, followed by the accumulation of gas
              onto these cores. Thus, the gas-giant cores must have formed
              before dissipation of the solar nebula, which likely occurred
              within less than 10 My after Solar System formation. Although such
              rapid accretion of the gas-giant cores has successfully been
              modeled, until now it has not been possible to date their
              formation. Here, using molybdenum and tungsten isotope
              measurements on iron meteorites, we demonstrate that meteorites
              derive from two genetically distinct nebular reservoirs that
              coexisted and remained spatially separated between ∼1 My and ∼3-4
              My after Solar System formation. The most plausible mechanism for
              this efficient separation is the formation of Jupiter, opening a
              gap in the disk and preventing the exchange of material between
              the two reservoirs. As such, our results indicate that Jupiter's
              core grew to ∼20 Earth masses within <1 My, followed by a more
              protracted growth to ∼50 Earth masses until at least ∼3-4 My after
              Solar System formation. Thus, Jupiter is the oldest planet of the
              Solar System, and its solid core formed well before the solar
              nebula gas dissipated, consistent with the core accretion model

              irons. Here we report the elemental chemistry of this group and
              model its crystallization history. Included are new elemental data
              for IIIF irons acquired by both instrumental neutron activation
              analysis (INAA) and laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass
              spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). A fractional-crystallization model was
              used to evaluate the IIIF compositional trends for 19 elements and
              was unable to explain the observed fractionation trends for
              several key elements (Co, Ga, Ge). In particular, the inability of
              this model to match Co in the IIIF irons is striking because (1)
              group IIIF has the widest Co variation among all magmatic iron
              groups and (2) none of the tested initial S contents (0–20 wt.\%)
              explains both the wide Co variation and steep Co-As slope.
              Attempts to fit subsets of the IIIF irons were also unsuccessful.
              In addition, group IIIF has the greatest variety of structural
              classes and kamacite bandwidths among all established magmatic
              iron groups. If the IIIF irons constitute a coherent group, they
              were derived from a parent body that experienced more complex
              processes than simple fractional crystallization of the core. The
              Zinder and Northwest Africa (NWA) 1911 pyroxene-bearing pallasites
              were recently suggested to be related to group IIIF based on their
              Ga and Ge contents, and we completed a petrographic study of the
              pallasite silicates and LA-ICP-MS analyses of their metal
              fractions. The two pallasites are related to one another: they
              have nearly identical mineralogical, elemental and O-isotopic
              compositions in their silicates and metals. Their metallic
              compositions resemble those of the IIIF irons Moonbi, St.

              that same line. No chondritic meteorite group has the same
              isotopic signature as the basaltic achondrites, so the oxygen
              isotope ratios of several known chondritic groups were used to
              construct a two component mixing model for the composition of the
              precursor. This model does not provide a unique solution, as
              several mixtures of ordinary and carbonaceous precursors will
              satisfy the isotopic constraints. The FeMnMg abundances of the
              precursors and of the eucrites were used to provide an additional
              constraint. The precursor composition selected for study is a
              mixture of 70\% (wt) H-chondrite with 30\% (wt) CM-chondrtte. This
              mixture generates a slightly FeO-rich silicate precursor that,
              after reduction and separation of an iron + sulfide core, is
              compatible with the mantle of the basaltic achondrite planetoid
              (BAP) having a similar composition to that modeled by Dreibus and
              Wänke (1980). Partial melting experiments of this H-CM precursor
              composition suggest that eucritic magmas could be formed in such a
              mantle. These experiments also suggest that the mantle must have
              experienced metal loss to constrain the Fe/Mn ratios and probably
              significant olivine fractionation as well. Diogenite precursors
              may also be generated in this mantle composition as FeO reduction
              and olivine fractionation lead to the formation of SiO2 enriched
              compositions from which diogenite source magmas may be extracted.
              If mixing of material from two very distinct chondritic reservoirs
              (H and CM-chondrites) is realistic, then an asteroid scale mixing
              process is needed to generate the achondrite precursor. Large
              impact events would provide a plausible method for mixing material
              from reservoirs with quite different oxygen isotope
              characteristics to assemble the basaltic achondrite planetoid.",

               to obtain petrologic, trace element, and O-isotopic data. Both
               meteorites contain low-Ca and high-Ca pyroxenes (<2\% by volume)
               and have been dubbed “pyroxene pallasites.” Pyroxene occurs as
               large individual grains, as inclusions in olivine and in other
               pyroxene, and as grains along the edges of olivine. Symplectic
               overgrowths, sometimes found in Main Group and Eagle Station
               pallasites, are not seen in the pyroxene pallasites. Olivine
               compositions are Fa10–12, similar to those of Main Group
               pallasites. Siderophile trace element data show that metal in the
               two meteorites have significantly differing compositions that
               are, for many elements, outside the range of the Main Group and
               Eagle Station pallasites. These compositions also differ from
               those of IAB and IIIAB iron meteorites. Rare earth element (REE)
               patterns in merrillite are similar to those seen in other
               pallasites, indicating formation by subsolidus reaction between
               metal and silicate, with the merrillite inheriting its pattern
               from the surrounding silicates. The O-isotopic compositions of
               Vermillion and Y-8451 are similar but differ from Main Group or
               Eagle Station pallasites, as well as other achondrite and
               primitive achondrite groups. Although Vermillion and Y-8451 have
               similar mineralogy, pyroxene compositions, REE patterns, and
               O-isotopic compositions, there is sufficient evidence to resist
               formally grouping these two meteorites. This evidence includes
               the texture of Vermillion, siderophile trace element data, and
               the presence of cohenite in Vermillion.",

               a typical main-group pallasite in most respects. We examined
               petrographically a slab ∼1 m long having an area of 3000 cm2 that
               shows the typical pallasitic texture with fragmental olivine.
               Phase abundances (in vol\%) are olivine (66\%), metal (32\%),
               schreibersite (0.76\%), troilite (0.46\%) and chromite (0.31\%).
               Esquel can be divided into four lithologies: (1) “pallasitic”
               matrix consisting of olivine fragments embedded in metal (81\%);
               (2) large (>5 cm) olivine nodules having low metal contents
               (18\%); (3) massive metal (0.3\%); and (4) zones dominated by FeS
               and fine olivine (0.7\%). Main-group pallasites appear to have
               formed by the intrusion of a highly evolved (low Ir, high Ni, Au
               and S) metallic magma into fragmented olivine. This model implies
               that FeS should be abundant in main-group pallasites, and we had
               speculated that examination of an exceptionally large slab might
               reveal a high troilite content. We found instead an exceptionally
               low FeS content. New compositional data confirm that Esquel has a
               lower Au content than other main-group pallasites having similar
               Ir contents. Literature data (based, however, on relatively small
               sections) suggest that high-Au pallasites have higher S contents
               than Esquel but have lower S contents than expected from a
               trapped-melt model. We conclude that a relatively complex model
               is required to explain the origin of main-group pallasites. After
               intrusion, the degree of crystallization of the metallic magma
               varied from location to location but, in almost all cases, an
               FeS-rich liquid either escaped or formed FeS-rich pallasitic
               rocks that are underrepresented in the meteorite inventory.",

               analyses of these phosphates to investigate the magmatic history

               seven other pallasites, the phosphates have relatively low

               enriched in heavy relative to light REE. These patterns are
               consistent with formation of phosphate by subsolidus reactions
               between metal and silicate, in which phosphate inherits the REE
               pattern of olivine. In Spring-water and Santa Rosalia,

               crystallization of a single molten metallic core during
               solidification. Group IIIAB irons cooling rates vary by a factor
               of 6 from 56 to 338°C/My. The cooling rate variation for each

               greatly reduced. The lack of correction for the orientation of
               the kamacite–taenite interface in the cooling rate measurement of
               a given meteorite in previous studies not only leads to large

               results are indistinguishable from the data obtained on Groups
               IAB, IIAB, IID, IIIAB, IVA, and IVB iron meteorites. Pallasite
               data were obtained on samples of the Main Group, which have been
               considered related to Group IIIAB irons, and on samples of the
               distinctive pallasites Eagle Station, Finmarken, and Marjalahti.
               It appears that iron meteorites and pallasites crystallized
               within a time interval of 20 Ma. This result is consistent with
               the evidence from the short-lived chronometers 107Pd-107Ag and
               53Mn-53Cr. It is also consistent with the evidence from
               182Hf-182W that the time interval over which molten FeNi metal
               from different iron meteorites equilibrated with and became
               segregated from silicates was ∼10 Ma. The well-defined
               187Re-187Os whole-rock isochron for pallasites and iron
               meteorites requires that they were formed in parent bodies that
               had been partially molten and segregated FeNi metal and FeS and
               then all crystallized within a 20 Ma time interval. This
               conclusion appears to apply to members of distinct groups of iron
               meteorites and pallasites which are viewed as not being
               cogenetic. The short time-scale requires that the irons and
               pallasites were formed in small parent planets of ≲10 km radius
               or near the surface of larger bodies. In contrast to the
               pallasites, we find that FeNi samples from mesosiderites have a
               narrow range in Re/Os so that it is not possible to determine a
               whole-rock isochron for these samples. The mesosiderite data also
               lie somewhat displaced from the iron meteorite and pallasite
               isochron indicating a more complex multi-stage evolution. Based
               on Sm-Nd data on mesosiderite silicate clasts, the Re-Os results
               on mesosiderite metal are compatible with the model of melted or
               partially molten FeNi cores or pods still preserved in
               protoplanetary bodies when these bodies were disrupted up to 150
               Ma after early formation and the FeNi was splashed onto the
               surfaces of other small, differentiated planetesimals.",

               constraints this can place on the origin and formation of these
               meteorites. Whole-rock samples of iron meteorites yielded a range
               in δ15N values from −96 to +156\%. Most of the nitrogen is found
               in the Fe, Ni metal phase, with areas of plessite containing ca.

               lower, although occasionally high concentrations (up to ≈40\%) of
               nitrogen can be found in nitrides. The nitrogen isotopic
               composition of the nitrides, and other phases present, is
               typically less than ±5\%. of that of the whole-rock value. The
               effect of extreme shock and/or recrystallisation of the metal
               phase is to cause a loss of nitrogen and a corresponding shift in
               δ15N values towards heavier values by up to 50\%. due to
               diffusive loss of nitrogen. In contrast, the range of δ15N values
               shown by other members of an individual group with more normal
               shock features is <11\%. For group IIIAB specimens this
               intragroup variation appears to be due to a slight loss of
               nitrogen during crystallisation, this mechanism having been taken
               to extreme conditions during the pallasite formation event. In
               the non-magmatic IAB group, individual samples display almost no
               isotopic variation. The nitrogen abundance in irons appears to be
               closely linked to the concentration of volatile trace elements
               and, although this may be the result of condensation effects, the
               high levels of nitrogen abundance may suggest that these levels
               were set during a re-equilibration event on the parent bodies. On
               the other hand, the only parameter with which δ15N values show
               any systematic covariation are the metallographic cooling rates
               of the irons, suggesting an indirect link between nitrogen and
               the internal heat source of the parent bodies. One possibility is
               that there may have been an injection of15N-rich nitrogen
               together with a short-lived radionuclide such as26Al, or
               perhaps60Fe, into the solar nebula prior to formation of the

               the first 2million years of the Solar System should be
               characterised by deficits in the abundance of 26Mg (δ26Mg∗) due
               to the absence of in-growth of 26Mg from the decay of short-lived
               26Al (t1/2=0.73Myr). However, these 26Mg deficits will be small
               (δ26Mg∗ >−0.037‰) even for material that formed at the same time
               as the Solar System’s oldest solids – calcium–aluminium-rich
               inclusions – and thus measurement of these deficits is
               analytically challenging. Here, we report on a search for 26Mg
               deficits in three types of ultramafic meteorites (pallasites,
               ureilites and aubrites) by multiple-collector inductively coupled
               plasma mass spectrometry. A range of analytical tests were
               carried out including analysis of: (1) a range of synthetic Mg
               solution standards; (2) Mg gravimetrically doped with a high
               purity 26Mg spike; (3) Mg cuts collected sequentially from cation
               exchange separation columns with fractionated stable Mg isotope
               compositions; (4) Mg separated from samples that was bracketed by
               analyses of both DSM-3 and Mg separated from a natural olivine
               sample subjected to the same chemical processing as the samples.
               These tests confirm it is possible to resolve differences in
               δ26Mg∗ from the terrestrial materials that are ⩽0.005‰. However,
               if Mg yields from chemical separation are low or an inappropriate
               equilibrium-isotopically fractionated standard is used this will
               generate analytical artefacts on δ26Mg∗ when this is calculated
               with the kinetic/exponential mass fractionation law as is the
               case when correcting for instrumental mass bias during mass
               spectrometric analysis. Olivine from four different main group
               pallasites and four bulk ureilites have small deficits in the
               abundance of 26Mg with δ26MgDSM-3∗=-0.0120±0.0018‰ and
               δ26MgDSM-3∗=-0.0062±0.0023‰, respectively, relative to
               terrestrial olivine (δ26MgDSM-3∗=+0.0029±0.0028‰). Six aubrites
               have δ26MgDSM-3∗=+0.0015±0.0020‰, which is identical to
               terrestrial olivine. Model ages from these deficits can be
               calculated by assuming that 26Al was homogeneously distributed in
               the planetesimal-forming regions of the proto-planetary disc at
               the same level as calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs). The
               absence of 26Mg deficits in aubrites, means these can only be
               constrained to have formed relatively late >2.9Myr after CAI
               formation. Model ages calculated from pallasite olivine deficits
               would suggest that pallasite olivine crystallised and was
               diffusively isolated on its parent body 1.24-0.28+0.40Myr after
               formation of CAIs. Similarly, ureilites would have experienced
               silicate partial melting and lowering of their bulk Al/Mg ratios
               1.9-0.7+2.2Myr after CAI formation. The model ages for silicate
               differentiation on the main group pallasite parent body are
               intermediate between those for metal-silicate fractionation for
               core formation obtained from magmatic iron meteorites and those
               for asteroidal silicate magmatism obtained from basaltic
               meteorites.",

               nanoscale intergrowth of Ni-rich islands within a Ni-poor matrix
               that forms below ∼350°C by spinodal decomposition. The sizes of
               the islands have long been recognized as reflecting the
               low-temperature cooling rates of meteorite parent bodies.
               However, a model capable of providing quantitative cooling rate
               estimates from island sizes has been lacking. Moreover, these
               islands are also capable of preserving a record of the ambient
               magnetic field as they grew, but some of the key physical
               parameters required for recovering reliable paleointensity
               estimates from magnetic measurements of these islands have been
               poorly constrained. To address both of these issues, we present a
               numerical model of the structural and compositional evolution of
               the cloudy zone as a function of cooling rate and local
               composition. Our model produces island sizes that are consistent
               with present-day measured sizes. This model enables a substantial
               improvement in the calibration of paleointensity estimates and
               associated uncertainties. In particular, we can now accurately
               quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the finite
               number of islands acquiring the magnetization and the uncertainty
               on their size at the time of the record. We use this new
               understanding to revisit paleointensities from previous
               pioneering paleomagnetic studies of cloudy zones. We show that
               these could have been overestimated by up to one order of
               magnitude but nevertheless still require substantial magnetic
               fields to have been present on their parent bodies. Our model
               also allows us to estimate absolute cooling rates for meteorites
               that cooled slower than <10,000°CMy−1. We demonstrate how these
               cooling rate estimates can uniquely constrain the low-temperature
               thermal history of meteorite parent bodies. Using the main-group
               pallasites as an example, we show that our results are consistent

               iron meteorites, which have δ57Fe/54Fe values ranging from 0.04‰
               to 0.2‰. At the mineral scale, taenite from two iron meteorites,
               Cranbourne and Toluca, shows δ57Fe/54Fe values heavier by up to
               0.3‰ than their kamacite counterpart, thus calling into question
               the significance of bulk iron meteorite data. On three pallasites
               (Esquel, Marjalahti and Springwater) we measured a heavier iron
               isotope composition for the metal fractions compared to the
               coexisting olivines as previously observed on two other
               pallasites (Eagle Station and Imilac), but the range of
               δ57Fe/54Fe differences (from 0.32‰ to 0.07‰) is larger than that
               originally found. Troilite from two pallasites appears to be even
               heavier than the metal fraction, whereas schreibersite is lighter
               than its olivine counterpart. There is thus a general tendency
               for minerals within a given rock to show a heavier Fe isotope
               composition as the coordination number of Fe increases, although
               troilite is an exception to this rule. Iron meteorites are
               classically considered as remnants of asteroid cores and
               pallasites as core–mantle interfaces. The simultaneous finding
               that the metal fractions of pallasites have a higher δ57Fe/54Fe
               signature than the coexisting olivines, and that the iron
               meteorites are slightly heavier than chondrites could be taken as
               an indication that planetary core–mantle differentiation is
               accompanied by sizeable iron isotope fractionation. In this
               hypothesis, mass balance constraints imply that resultant
               planetary mantles should be isotopically lighter than the
               chondritic starting material. That is not observed, however,
               since all planetary mantles analyzed so far have δ57Fe/54Fe
               values equivalent to or heavier than those of chondrites. It thus
               appears that the moderate temperature and pressure metal–silicate
               fractionation that occurred in pallasite and iron parent bodies
               is not readily transposable to planets as far as Fe isotopes are
               concerned. Instead, these mantle signatures could reflect
               equilibrium fractionation at a higher temperature, or the lack of
               a global core–mantle equilibration at the planetary scale.
               Overall, these new results show that the mass-dependent isotopic
               scatter observed among inner solar system bodies from the
               bulk-rock to the planetary scale (∼0.3‰ δ57Fe/54Fe) is more
               restricted than previously thought. This likely confirms a

               as lodranite meteorites, indicates that metal did not segregate
               from silicates when the amount of partial melting was only 15\%.
               Thus, core formation in asteroids requires substantial melting of
               an asteroid. High interfacial energies between metallic melts and
               silicates require that metallic spherules sink through partially
               molten silicates to form cores in asteroids and planetesimals.
               The globule-sinking mechanism is not very efficient because
               silicate crystal-liquid mixtures have high yield strengths,
               making it difficult for the globules to sink. Calculations
               suggest that the melt fraction must reach >50\% before globules
               can sink. Alternatively, porous flow of molten metal is possible
               when the amount of metal is high enough to form an interconnected
               network, about 50\%; this can be achieved by high initial
               abundances of metal or by gradual removal of silicate melt,
               thereby enriching the residue in the metal-sulfide assemblage.
               This also requires removal of 50\% silicate partial melt, though
               not necessarily all at once. Such high amounts of melting were
               not always attained in asteroids, so many asteroids probably
               consist of partially differentiated silicates and metallic masses
               that did not segregate to a core. S asteroids might represent
               such partially differentiated bodies.",

               roughly chondritic in terms of refractory components, and this
               means that metal and silicate should be present together in early
               planetesimals. To fully understand the metal-silicate
               differentiation process within the eucrite parent body (EPB), it
               is important to try and identify the metal reservoir that is
               complementary to the silicate part. The isotope 182 of tungsten
               (W), a siderophile element, is partly formed from the decay of
               182Hf, and W isotopes are useful for examining metal-silicate
               segregation. The W isotopic composition expected for the metal
               that is complementary to eucrites falls in the range of iron
               meteorites. However, mesosiderites seem to be genetically linked
               to eucrites based on petrologic and oxygen isotopic similarities.
               Therefore, we undertook the analysis of the metal phase of these
               stony-irons. Here we present tungsten isotopic data for
               mesosiderite and pallasite metal to characterize their parent
               body (bodies) and to assess possible relationships with eucrites.
               All stony-iron metals are depleted in radiogenic tungsten by −1.3
               to −4.2 ε units, relative to the terrestrial standard, while
               chondrites, for comparison, are depleted by −1.9 ε units. In
               addition to W isotopic heterogeneity from one stony-iron to
               another, there is also W isotopic heterogeneity within individual
               meteorites. A formation model is tentatively proposed, where we
               show that mesosiderites, pallasites, and eucrites could possibly
               come from the same parent body. Several hypotheses are discussed
               to explain the isotopic heterogeneity: the production of
               cosmogenic tungsten, the in situ decay of hafnium present in
               inclusions, and tungsten diffusion processes after metal-silicate
               mixing during the cooling of the meteorites. The two latter
               hypotheses provide the best explanation of our data.",

              (Mars), (2) Earth and Moon, and (3) HED (howardites, eucrites,

              isotopic variations along a slope-12 fractionation line, as is
              well known for terrestrial materials. Variations of Δ17O from one
              planet to another are inherited from the inhomogeneities in the
              solar nebula, as illustrated by the isotopic compositions of
              chondrites and their constituents. Among the undifferentiated

              common reservoir, the isotopic composition of which was

              and lodranites, and (3) ureilites and dark inclusions of C3

              compositions of Earth, Mars, and the eucrite parent body with
              mixing models of their chemical compositions failed. It is not

               spectral signatures indicate that the asteroid is something
               perhaps even more enigmatic: a mixed metal and silicate world.
               Here we combine observations of Psyche with data from meteorites
               and models for planetesimal formation to produce the best current
               hypotheses for Psyche's properties and provenance. Psyche's bulk
               density appears to be between 3,400 and 4,100 kg m-3. Psyche is
               thus predicted to have between ~30 and ~60 vol\% metal, with the
               remainder likely low-iron silicate rock and not more than ~20\%
               porosity. Though their density is similar, mesosiderites are an
               unlikely analog to bulk Psyche because mesosiderites have far
               more iron-rich silicates than Psyche appears to have. CB
               chondrites match both Psyche's density and spectral properties,
               as can some pallasites, although typical pallasitic olivine
               contains too much iron to be consistent with the reflectance
               spectra. Final answers, as well as resolution of contradictions
               in the data set of Psyche physical properties, for example, the
               thermal inertia measurements, may not be resolved until the NASA

               range of compositions and formation processes for Psyche allowed

              models have not succeeded in both explaining the scatter among
              IIIAB irons around the main crystallization trends and using
              elemental partitioning behavior consistent with experimental
              determinations. This study outlines a revised approach for
              modeling the crystallization of irons that uses experimentally
              determined partition coefficients and can reproduce the IIIAB
              trends and their associated scatter for 12 siderophile elements
              simultaneously. A key advancement of this revised trapped melt
              model is the inclusion of an effect on the resulting solid metal
              composition due to the formation of troilite. The revised trapped
              melt model supports the previous conclusion that trapped melt
              played an important role in the genesis of IIIAB irons and matches
              the trace element fractionation trends observed in the Cape York
              suite as due to different amounts of trapped melt. Applying the
              revised trapped melt model to 16 elements as well as S and Fe, the
              bulk composition of the IIIAB core is found to have a composition
              consistent with that expected from a chondritic precursor for
              refractory siderophile elements but with evidence for depletions
              of more volatile elements. The bulk S composition of the IIIAB
              core is estimated as 9 ± 1 wt\%, implying that a substantial
              amount of S-rich material from the IIIAB core is underrepresented
              in our meteorite collections. Future applications of the revised

               formation of these meteorites. Large sections of pallasites with
               angular olivines commonly contain olivine masses 5–30 cm in size,
               which appear to have been disintegrating into smaller fragments,
               like those dispersed through the metal. It is suggested that
               these masses were parts of olivine layers, which were intruded by
               underlying molten metal. Gravitational separation of olivine and
               metal was probably prevented by incipient solidification of
               metal. Pallasites with rounded olivines probably had a fairly
               similar history, but with additional annealing after metal
               solidification had started. Grain boundary energy was reduced by
               decreasing the area of metal-olivine interface and increasing the
               contact between touching olivines. Because of the vastly
               different nature of metal and olivine, their mutual interfacial
               energy is high and the degree of anisotropy of this energy is
               low. The occurrence of profuse, small faces on rounded olivines
               is therefore consistent with the ‘metamorphic’ origin which is
               proposed for rounded olivines. In many pallasites with
               angularolivine macrostructures, magnifications of 5–50 × reveal
               similar rounding effects, including aggregates of rounded
               olivines, and individual crystals which may be faceted. The high
               metal-troilite ratio of Phillips County suggests that this
               pallasite formed by mixing of olivine with S-rich liquid metal
               around 1000°C, near the Fe-FeS eutectic temperature.",

  abstract  = "The origin of pallasites—stony-iron meteorites mainly composed of
               olivine and Fe-Ni metal—is debated and proposed formation
               scenarios broadly range from models that explain pallasite
               formation by internal processes in the mantle of a differentiated
               planetesimal to those that involve impact–induced mixing of core
               and mantle materials. Here, the origin of pallasites is examined
               by studying the nebular source regions of their precursor
               material using Mo isotopes and their history of metal-silicate
               segregation using Hf-W chronometry. We report new Mo and W
               isotopic data for a large suite of pallasite metal samples,
               alongside Pt isotope data to quantify superimposed cosmic ray
               exposure effects. Most main-group pallasites exhibit uniform
               pre-exposure 182W and Mo isotopic compositions that bear an
               excellent similarity to those of IIIAB iron meteorites. Four
               main-group pallasites and the IIIAB iron Thunda have more
               radiogenic pre-exposure 182W compositions, but display the same
               Mo isotopic composition as other main-group pallasites and IIIAB
               irons. This strong chronological and genetic link strongly
               suggests that main-group pallasite metal originated in the IIIAB
               parent body core. This, combined with prior Pd-Ag chronometric
               evidence for an early collisional disruption of the IIIAB parent
               body, implies that main-group pallasites formed by impact–induced
               mixing of metal and silicates rather than by an internal process
               on the IIIAB parent body. This mixing led to elevated 182W
               compositions in some pallasites, which are best accounted for by
               partial re-equilibration of IIIAB metal with radiogenic 182W from
               the colliding body. Collectively, our results support models that
               explain main-group pallasite formation by injection of pallasite
               metal into the mantle of another differentiated body, implying
               that pallasite silicates did not primarily derive from the IIIAB
               mantle, but instead from that of the colliding body.",

               single putative parent body while others (like ?pallasites?)
               subsume texturally similar objects of multifarious solar system
               origins. The familiar concept of ?group? as representative of one
               primary parent body is also difficult to define empirically. It
               is proposed that the classification becomes explicitly binominal
               throughout the meteorite spectrum, with classes referring to
               petrographically defined primary rock types, whereas groups
               retain a genetic meaning, but no longer tied to any assumption on
               the number of represented parent bodies. The classification of a
               meteorite would thus involve both a class and a group, in a
               two-dimensional fashion analogous to the way Van Schmus and Wood
               decoupled primary and secondary properties in chondrites. Since
               groups would not substantially differ, at first, from those in
               current use de facto, the taxonomic treatment of ?normal?
               meteorites, whose class would bring no new information, would
               hardly change. Yet classes combined with high- or low-level
               groups would provide a standardized grid to characterize
               petrographically and/or isotopically unusual or anomalous
               meteorites?which make up the majority of represented meteorite
               parent bodies?for example, in relation to the
               carbonaceous/noncarbonaceous dichotomy. In the longer term, the
               mergers of genetically related groups, a more systematic
               treatment of lithology mixtures, and the chondrite/achondrite
               transition can further simplify the nomenclature.",

               requires the prior pile-up of dust in the protoplanetary disk4,5.
               This has been successfully modelled exclusively at the disk’s
               snowline6–9, whereas rocky planetesimals in the inner disk were
               only obtained by assuming either unrealistically large particle
               sizes10,11 or an enhanced global disk metallicity12. However,
               planetesimal formation solely at the snowline is difficult to
               reconcile with the early and contemporaneous formation of iron
               meteorite parent bodies with distinct oxidation states13,14 and
               isotopic compositions15, indicating formation at different radial
               locations in the disk. Here, by modelling the evolution of a disk
               with ongoing accretion of material from the collapsing molecular
               cloud16–18, we show that planetesimal formation may have been
               triggered within the first 0.5 million years by dust pile-up at
               both the snowline (at ~5 au) and the silicate sublimation line
               (at ~1 au), provided turbulent diffusion was low. Particle
               concentration at ~1 au is due to the early outward radial motion
               of gas19 and is assisted by the sublimation and recondensation of
               silicates20,21. Our results indicate that, although the
               planetesimals at the two locations formed about
               contemporaneously, those at the snowline accreted a large
               fraction of their mass (~60\%) from materials delivered to the
               disk in the first few tens of thousands of years, whereas this
               fraction is only 30\% for the planetesimals formed at the
               silicate line. Thus, provided that the isotopic composition of
               the delivered material changed with time22, these two
               planetesimal populations should have distinct isotopic
               compositions, consistent with observations15. An evolutionary
               model of the solar protoplanetary disk that includes the decrease
               of its viscosity with time and the accretion of gas from the
               interstellar medium shows that planetesimals formed
               simultaneously in two locations: at the water snowline (~5 au)
               and at the silicate sublimation line (~1 au), explaining the
               observed isotopic dichotomy of iron meteorites.",

               understood, with a quiescent core?mantle boundary, violent
               core?mantle mixture, or surface mixture all recently suggested.
               Here, we review main group pallasite data sets and petrologic
               characteristics, and present new observations on the low-MnO
               pallasite Brahin that contains abundant fragmental olivine, but
               also rounded and angular olivine and potential evidence of
               sulfide?phosphide liquid immiscibility. A reassessment of the
               literature shows that low-MnO and high-FeO subgroups
               preferentially host rounded olivine and low-temperature P2O5-rich
               phases such as the Mg-phosphate farringtonite and phosphoran
               olivine. These phases form after metal and silicate reservoirs
               back-react during decreasing temperature after initial
               separation, resulting in oxidation of phosphorus and chromium.
               Farringtonite and phosphoran olivine have not been found in the
               common subgroup PMG, which are mechanical mixtures of olivine,
               chromite with moderate Al2O3 contents, primitive solid metal, and
               evolved liquid metal. Lower concentrations of Mn in olivine of

               olivine indicate that the core?mantle boundary of their

              Earth. In order to constrain the composition of the Earth we must
              fully understand the processes by which newly formed Earth, and
              the bodies which accreted to it, differentiated. Percolation of
              iron-rich melt through solid silicate has been invoked as a
              mechanism for differentiation and core formation in terrestrial
              bodies in the early solar system. However, to date the
              contribution of percolation to core formation cannot be assessed
              due to the absence of data on Fe-rich melt migration velocities.
              Here we use a novel experimental design to investigate textural
              changes in an analog system, Au melt in polycrystalline h-BN, at 3
              GPa, relevant to core formation in the early solar system. Using a
              combination of high resolution, in-situ X-ray tomography and fast
              2-D radiographic imaging, we obtain the first direct data on melt
              migration velocities at high PT. Melt migration is highly variable
              and episodic, driven by variations in differential pressure during
              melt migration and matrix compaction. Smaller scale melt
              processes, representing migration of melt along pre-existing melt
              networks, give comparatively fast velocities of 0.6–60 μms−1.
              Ex-situ experiments are used to compare melt networks in analog
              systems to Fe-rich melt in silicates. Two competing processes for
              melt migration are percolation of melt along grain boundaries, and
              hydraulic fracturing induced by melt injection. Typically, both
              processes are noted in experimental and natural systems, although
              the relative importance of each mechanism is variable. Using a
              simple model for melt flow through a porous media, migration
              velocities determined here account for full differentiation of
              Earth-sized bodies within 101–103 Myr, for submicron diameter melt
              bands, or within a few Myr or micron-sized melt bands. This is
              consistent with rapid timescales inferred from geochemistry for
              core formation in planetesimals, implying that percolation may
              have had an important contribution to core differentiation in the

               mechanism leading to the genesis of the sub-group termed ‘mixed
               type’ pallasites (containing polygonal, rounded, and fragmental
               olivines simultaneously) is unclear. Here we test the hypothesis
               of mixing of olivine fragments with Fe–Ni–S after a
               non-destructive impact followed by annealing employing both
               experimental analogues and numerical models. The experimental
               series evidenced that the addition of sulfur to olivine + Fe–Ni
               accelerates olivine grain growth, though the growth rate is
               reduced when Fe–Ni–S is not fully molten. This is shown to be the
               consequence of competing growth of olivine and Fe–Ni grains.
               Numerical models satisfying available formation constraints from
               natural samples indicate that planetesimals with radii ≥200 km

               from the outside in1, as evidenced by palaeomagnetic measurements

               outside-in solidification and fate of residual core melt are
               poorly understood. For a core primarily composed of iron and
               nickel alloyed with lighter constituent elements such as sulfur,
               this inward core growth would probably be achieved by growth of
               solid iron–nickel dendrites4. Growth of iron–nickel dendrites
               results in interconnected pockets of residual melt that become
               progressively enriched in sulfur up to a eutectic composition of
               31 wt\% sulfur as iron–nickel continues to solidify4. Here, we
               show that regions of residual sulfur-enriched iron–nickel melt in
               the core attain sufficient excess pressures to propagate via
               dykes into the mantle. Thus, core material will intrude into the
               overlying rocky mantle or possibly even erupt onto the
               planetesimal’s surface. We refer to these processes collectively
               as ferrovolcanism. Our calculations show that ferrovolcanic
               surface eruptions are more likely on bodies with mantles less
               than 50 km thick. We show that intrusive ferromagmatism can
               produce pallasites, an enigmatic class of meteorites composed of
               olivine crystals entrained in a matrix of iron–nickel metal4.
               Ferrovolcanic eruptions may explain the observations that
               asteroid 16 Psyche has a bulk density inconsistent with iron
               meteorites5 yet shows evidence of a metallic surface
               composition6. Pockets of iron-rich melt within asteroids get
               progressively enriched in sulfur while the asteroid is cooling,
               generating excess pressure that can push the melt up to the
               surface. This ‘ferrovolcanism’ can be the origin of the
               stony-iron pallasite meteorites and can explain the contradicting

               because their main constituents—iron and olivine—should have
               segregated into layers inside their parent body. The generally
               accepted model suggests that they formed at the coremantle
               boundary of an asteroid. Tarduno et al. (p. 939; see the
               Perspective by Weiss) measured a remnant magnetization in olivine
               crystals of two pallasite meteorites and conclude that a dynamo
               must have operated in their parent body, providing further
               evidence that some asteroids were capable of dynamo generation.
               The data, together with thermal modeling, suggest that some
               pallasites could have formed when liquid FeNi from the core of an
               impacting asteroid was injected into the mantle of a large
               protoplanet. Some pallasite meteorites might have formed when
               liquid FeNi from an impactor was injected into their parent
               body’s mantle. Understanding the origin of pallasites, stony-iron
               meteorites made mainly of olivine crystals and FeNi metal, has

               dynamo action in the pallasite parent body. We use these data and
               thermal modeling to suggest that some pallasites formed when
               liquid FeNi from the core of an impactor was injected as dikes
               into the shallow mantle of a 200-kilometer-radius protoplanet.

               fraction which although small, <1 wt\% in most cases, nonetheless
               contributes significantly to the budgets of some nuclides (e.g.,
               up to 35\% for 21Ne and 26Al). A correction for olivine is
               therefore essential and was made using model calculations and/or
               empirical relations for the production rates of cosmogenic
               nuclides in iron meteoroids and/or measured elemental
               concentrations. Cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages for the metal
               phases of the main-group pallasites range from 7 to 180 Ma, but
               many of the ages cluster around a central peak near 100 Ma. These
               CRE ages suggest that the parent body of the main-group
               pallasites underwent a major break-up that produced most of the
               meteorites analyzed. The CRE age distribution for the pallasites
               overlaps only a small fraction of the distribution for the IIIAB
               iron meteorites. Most pallasites and IIIAB irons originated in
               different collisions, probably on different parent bodies; a few
               IIIABs and pallasites may have come out of the same collision but
               a firm conclusion requires further study. CRE ages calculated
               from noble gas and radionuclide data of the metal fraction are
               higher on average than the 21Ne exposure ages obtained for the
               olivine samples. As the metal and olivine fractions were taken in
               most cases from different specimens, the depth-dependency of the
               production rate ratio 10Be/21Ne in metal, not accounted for in
               our calculations, may explain the difference.",

               difference between metal and silicates in pallasites may be
               expected. We report a statistically significant oxygen isotope
               disequilibrium between olivine and chromite in main group

               amounts of Fe-Ni and troilite, likely represent well-preserved
               samples of different mantle regions of pallasite parent bodies
               (PPBs). We investigated olivine aggregates from the main group
               pallasites Fukang, Esquel, Imilac, and Seymchan and compare their
               textures with results from deformation experiments. Our
               measurements reveal an inverse relationship between the grain
               size of olivines and the primary metal fraction inside olivine
               aggregates, which is explained by simultaneous grain growth
               retarded by Zener pinning in different mantle regions. Textural
               evidence indicates that the mantle has remained at high
               temperatures before initial cooling occurred shortly after
               pallasite formation that was likely caused by an impact.
               Different degrees of annealing of the deformation textures
               suggest that the postcollisional cooling occurred in the order
               Seymchan, Imilac, Esquel, and Fukang. We interpret this

               We also demonstrate that the mantle has not been convecting
               before the impact despite being at high temperature. Using the
               minimum critical Rayleigh number, we estimate PPB radii assuming

               lamellae of known crystallographic orientation in metallic
               regions with Widmanstätten patterns. Comparison with profiles
               generated by modeling kamacite growth gave cooling rates ranging
               from 2.5 to 18K/Myr. Relative cooling rates were also inferred
               from the sizes of cloudy zone particles in 28 MG pallasites
               (86–170nm) and tetrataenite bandwidths in 20 MG pallasites
               (1050–2170nm), as these parameters are positively correlated with
               each other and negatively correlated with the metallographic
               cooling rates. These three different techniques show that MG
               pallasites cooled below 975K at significantly diverse rates.
               Since samples from the core–mantle boundary should have
               indistinguishable cooling rates, MG pallasites could not have
               cooled at this location. Group IIIAB irons, which were previously
               thought to be core samples from the MG pallasite body, have
               faster cooling rates (∼50–350K/Myr) and smaller cloudy zone
               particle sizes and tetrataenite bandwidths. This shows that IIIAB
               irons cooled faster than MG pallasites and could not plausibly be
               from the same body. The absence of related iron meteorites and
               achondrites and our thermal constraints suggest that MG
               pallasites cooled at diverse depths in a pallasitic body
               consisting of well-mixed olivine and metallic Fe–Ni. Such a body
               may have formed during an impact on a differentiated asteroid or
               protoplanet that mixed olivine mantle fragments with residual
               Ir-poor molten metal from the outermost part of a core that
               chemically resembled the IIIAB core and was ∼80\% fractionally
               crystallized. Separation of the solid core and most of the
               associated mantle may have resulted from a grazing hit-and-run
               impact with a larger protoplanet or asteroid. Thermal
               calculations suggest that the radius of the pallasitic body was

              into the formation of terrestrial planets. However, pallasite
              origin is controversial, either sampling the core-mantle boundary
              or the shallower mantle of planetesimals that suffered an impact.
              We present high strain-rate deformation experiments with the model
              system olivine + FeS melt ± gold melt to investigate pallasite
              formation and the evolution of their parent bodies and compare the
              resulting microstructures to two samples of Seymchan pallasite.
              Our experiments reproduced the major textural features of
              pallasites including the different olivine shapes, olivine
              aggregates, and the distribution of the metal and sulfide phases.
              These results indicate that pallasites preserve evidence for a
              two-stage formation process including inefficient core-mantle
              differentiation and an impact causing disruption, metal melt
              injection, and fast cooling within months to years. Olivine
              aggregates, important constituents of angular pallasites, are
              reinterpreted as samples of a partially differentiated mantle
              containing primordial metallic melt not stemming from the
              impactor. The long-term retention of more than 10 vol\% of metal
              melt in a silicate mantle sampled by olivine aggregates indicates
              high effective percolation thresholds and inefficient
              metal-silicate differentiation in planetesimals not experiencing a

               of generating magnetic fields. Convection on these bodies is
               currently thought to have been thermally driven, implying that
               magnetic activity would have been short-lived. Here we report a
               time-series palaeomagnetic record derived from nanomagnetic
               imaging of the Imilac and Esquel pallasite meteorites, a group of
               meteorites consisting of centimetre-sized metallic and silicate
               phases. We find a history of long-lived magnetic activity on the

               of the magnetic field as core solidification completed. We

               solidification of an inner core is consistent with our measured

               Solidification-driven convection was probably common among small

              interpreted as an incomplete mixture of material from two
              carbon-rich chondritic reservoirs, one (Mg-rich) with reduced
              iron, low Δ17O and low δ13C, and the other with oxidised iron,
              high Δ17O and high δ13C. Here we analyse noble gases (Ar, Kr and
              Xe) in six equilibrated (unbrecciated) ureilites from Northwest
              Africa (NWA 2236, NWA 7686, NWA 8049, NWA 8172, NWA 11032 and NWA

              idea of the two-component mixing hypothesis. Our analyses further
              suggest that the Mg-rich endmember was rich in Xe from presolar
              grains (HL-Xe) while the Mg-poorer component may have contained
              solar-derived noble gases. The observed correlations are less
              straightforward to reconcile with a recent model for the origin of
              the ureilite parent body, involving oxidation of metal by H2O from

               differentiation scenarios, we have integrated a multistage
               core–mantle differentiation model with N-body accretion
               simulations. Impacts between embryos and planetesimals are
               considered to result in magma ocean formation and episodes of
               core formation. The core formation model combines rigorous
               chemical mass balance with metal–silicate element partitioning
               data and requires that the bulk compositions of all starting
               embryos and planetesimals are defined as a function of their
               heliocentric distances of origin. To do this, we assume that
               non-volatile elements are present in Solar System (CI) relative
               abundances in all bodies and that oxygen and H2O contents are the
               main compositional variables. The primary constraint on the
               combined model is the composition of the Earth’s primitive
               mantle. In addition, we aim to reproduce the composition of the
               martian mantle and the mass fractions of the metallic cores of
               Earth and Mars. The model is refined by least squares
               minimization with up to five fitting parameters that consist of
               the metal–silicate equilibration pressure and 1–4 parameters that
               define the starting compositions of primitive bodies. This
               integrated model has been applied to six Grand Tack N-body
               accretion simulations. Investigations of a broad parameter space
               indicate that: (1) accretion of Earth was heterogeneous, (2)
               metal–silicate equilibration pressures increase as accretion
               progresses and are, on average, 60–70\% of core–mantle boundary
               pressures at the time of each impact, and (3) a large fraction
               (70–100\%) of the metal of impactor cores equilibrates with a
               small fraction of the silicate mantles of proto-planets during
               each core formation event. Results are highly sensitive to the
               compositional model for the primitive starting bodies and several
               accretion/core-formation models can thus be excluded. Acceptable
               fits to the Earth’s mantle composition are obtained only when
               bodies that originated close to the Sun, at <0.9–1.2 AU, are
               highly reduced and those from beyond this distance are
               increasingly oxidized. Reasonable concentrations of H2O in
               Earth’s mantle are obtained when bodies originating from beyond
               6–7 AU contain 20 wt\% water ice (icy bodies that originated
               between the snow line and this distance did not contribute to
               Earth’s accretion because they were swept up by Jupiter and
               Saturn). In the six models examined, water is added to the Earth
               mainly after 60–80\% of its final mass has accreted. The
               compositional evolution of the mantles of Venus and Mars are also
               constrained by the model. The FeO content of the martian mantle
               depends critically on the heliocentric distance at which the
               Mars-forming embryo originated. Finally, the Earth’s core is
               predicted to contain 8–9 wt\% silicon, 2–4 wt\% oxygen and 10–60
               ppm hydrogen, whereas the martian core is predicted to contain
               low concentrations (<1 wt\%) of Si and O.",

              isotopic compositions of planetesimals formed in the
              noncarbonaceous (NC) protosolar isotopic reservoir. A refined 182W
              model age for the meteorites Campo del Cielo, Canyon Diablo, and
              Nantan suggests that the IAB-MG parent body underwent some form of
              metal-silicate segregation as early as 5.3 ± 0.4 Myr after
              calcium-aluminum rich inclusion (CAI) formation or as late as 13.8
              ± 1.4 Myr after CAI formation. If melting of the IAB-MG occurred
              prior to 7 Myr after CAI formation, it was likely driven by 26Al
              decay for a parent body radius >40 km. Otherwise, additional heat
              from impact is required for melting metal this late in Solar
              System history. If melting was partially or wholly the result of
              internal heating, a thermal model of 26Al decay heat production
              constrains the accretion age of the IAB-MG parent body to ~1.7 ±
              0.4 Myr after CAI formation. If melting was, instead, dominantly
              caused by impact heating, thermal modeling suggests the parent
              body accreted more than 2 Myr after CAI formation. Comparison of
              Mo mass independent isotopic compositions of the IAB-MG to other
              NC bodies with constrained accretion ages suggests that the Mo
              isotopic composition of the NC reservoir changed with time, and
              that the IAB-MG parent body accreted between 2 to 3 Myr after CAI
              formation, thus requiring an origin by impact. The relationship
              between nucleosynthetic Mo isotopic compositions and accretion
              ages of planetesimals from the NC reservoir suggests that isotopic
              heterogeneity developed from either addition of s-process material

  abstract = "Bronze Age iron artifacts could be derived from either meteoritic
              (extraterrestrial) or smelted (terrestrial) iron. This unresolved
              question is the subject of a controversy: are some, all or none
              made of smelted iron? In the present paper we propose a
              geochemical approach, which permits us to differentiate
              terrestrial from extraterrestrial irons. Instead of evaluating the
              Ni abundance alone (or the Ni to Fe ratio) we consider the
              relationship between Fe, Co and Ni abundances and their ratios.
              The study of meteoritic irons, Bronze Age iron artifacts and
              ancient terrestrial irons permit us to validate this chemical
              approach. The major interest is that non-invasive p-XRF analyses
              provide reliable Fe:Co:Ni abundances, without the need to remove a
              sample; they can be performed in situ, in the museums where the
              artifacts are preserved. The few iron objects from the Bronze Age
              sensu stricto that could be analyzed are definitely made of
              meteoritic iron, suggesting that speculations about precocious
              smelting during the Bronze Age should be revised. In a Fe:Co:Ni
              array the trend exhibited by meteoritic irons departs
              unambiguously from modern irons and iron ores. The trend of Ni/Fe
              vs Ni/Co in different analysis points of a single object corroded
              to variable extents provides a robust criterion for identifying
              the presence of meteoritic iron. It opens the possibility of
              tracking when and where the first smelting operations happened,
              the threshold of a new era. It emphasizes the importance of
              analytical methods for properly studying the evolution of the use
              of metals and metal working technologies in our past cultures.",

               metallurgy in different civilizations. The sporadic use of iron
               has been reported in the Eastern Mediterranean area from the late
               Neolithic period to the Bronze Age. Despite the rare existence of
               smelted iron, it is generally assumed that early iron objects
               were produced from meteoritic iron. Nevertheless, the methods of
               working the metal, its use, and diffusion are contentious issues
               compromised by lack of detailed analysis. Since its discovery in
               1925, the meteoritic origin of the iron dagger blade from the
               sarcophagus of the ancient Egyptian King Tutankhamun (14th C.
               BCE) has been the subject of debate and previous analyses yielded
               controversial results. We show that the composition of the blade
               (Fe plus 10.8 wt\% Ni and 0.58 wt\% Co), accurately determined
               through portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, strongly

               of metallographic analysis of ancient iron artifacts from Gerzeh,
               our study confirms that ancient Egyptians attributed great value
               to meteoritic iron for the production of precious objects.
               Moreover, the high manufacturing quality of Tutankhamun's dagger
               blade, in comparison with other simple-shaped meteoritic iron

               strong constraints on gas and ice giant formation in the core
               accretion scenario. The approximately 10-Earth-mass solid core
               responsible for the attraction of the gaseous envelope has to
               form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc is
               completed within 1–10 million years. Building up the core by
               collisions between km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this
               timescale constraint, especially at wide stellar separations.
               Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are detected by direct imaging at
               wide orbital distances. In this paper, we numerically study the
               growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles loosely
               coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed
               masses ranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown
               10-Earth-mass core and test different particle sizes. The
               numerical results are in good agreement with our analytic
               expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes,
               one set by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower
               seed masses and the other, for higher masses, by the velocity at
               the edge of the Hill sphere. In the former, the optimally
               accreted particle size increases with core mass, while in the
               latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass.
               We discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant
               and ice-giant cores. We conclude that pebble accretion can
               resolve the long-standing core accretion timescale conflict. This
               requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in the midplane, particle
               growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive planetesimals or
               low radial pressure support. The core growth timescale is
               shortened by a factor 30–1000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100–10 000
               at 50 AU, compared to the gravitationally focused accretion of,
               respectively, low-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard
               km-sized planetesimals.",

              several μT to several hundred μT. In fact, an achondrite parent

              generation and the dynamo process in particular may have been
              common. Here we present paleomagnetic measurements of the
              ungrouped achondrite NWA 7325 indicating that it last cooled in a

  abstract = "We present evidence for both early- and late-stage magnetic
              activity on the CV and L/LL parent bodies respectively from
              chondrules in Vigarano and Bjurböle. Using micro-CT scans to
              re-orientate chondrules to their in-situ positions, we present a
              new micron-scale protocol for the paleomagnetic conglomerate test.
              The paleomagnetic conglomerate test determines at 95\% confidence,
              whether clasts within a conglomerate were magnetized before or
              after agglomeration, i.e., for a chondritic meteorite whether the
              chondrules carry a pre- or post-accretionary remanent
              magnetization. We found both meteorites passed the conglomerate
              test, i.e., the chondrules had randomly orientated magnetizations.
              Vigarano's heterogeneous magnetization is likely of shock origin,
              due to the 10 to 20 GPa impacts that brecciated its precursor
              material on the parent body and transported it to re-accrete as
              the Vigarano breccia. The magnetization was likely acquired during
              the break-up of the original body, indicating a CV parent body
              dynamo was active ∼9 Ma after Solar System formation. Bjurböle's
              magnetization is due to tetrataenite, which transformed from
              taenite as the parent body cooled to below 320 °C, when an ambient
              magnetic field imparted a remanence. We argue either the high
              intrinsic anisotropy of tetrataenite or brecciation on the parent
              body manifests as a randomly orientated distribution, and a L/LL
              parent body dynamo must have been active at least 80 to 140 Ma
              after peak metamorphism. Primitive chondrites did not originate
              from entirely primitive, never molten and/or differentiated parent
              bodies. Primitive chondrite parent bodies consisted of a
              differentiated interior sustaining a long-lived magnetic dynamo,
              encrusted by a layer of incrementally accreted primitive
              meteoritic material. The different ages of carbonaceous and
              ordinary chondrite parent bodies might indicate a general
              difference between carbonaceous and ordinary chondrite parent
              bodies, and/or formation location in the protoplanetary disk.",

              the hypothesis that asteroid (16) Psyche formed from the core of a

              Magnetometer will measure the magnetic field around the asteroid
              to search for evidence of remanent magnetization. Paleomagnetic
              measurements of meteorites and dynamo theory indicate that a
              diversity of planetesimals once generated dynamo magnetic fields
              in their metallic cores. Likewise, the detection of a strong
              magnetic moment ( > 2 × 10 14 Am 2 ) at Psyche would likely
              indicate that the body once generated a core dynamo, implying that
              it formed by igneous differentiation. The Psyche Magnetometer
              consists of two three-axis fluxgate Sensor Units (SUs) mounted 0.7

              instrument noise of 39 pT axis - 1 3 σ integrated over 0.1 to 1

              extraterrestrial samples indicate that numerous planetary bodies
              generated magnetic fields through core dynamo activity during the
              early solar system. The existence, timing, intensity and stability
              of these fields are governed by the internal transfer of heat
              throughout their parent bodies. Thus, paleomagnetic records
              preserved in natural samples can contain key information regarding
              the accretion and thermochemical history of the rocky bodies in
              our solar system. However, models capable of predicting these
              field properties across the entire active lifetime of a planetary
              core that could relate the processes occurring within these bodies
              to features in these records and provide such information are
              limited. Here, we perform asteroid thermal evolution models across
              suites of radii, accretion times and thermal diffusivities with
              the aim of predicting when fully and partially differentiated
              asteroids generated magnetic fields. We find that dynamo activity
              in both types of asteroid is delayed until ∼4.5-5.5 Myr after
              calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion formation due to the partitioning
              of 26Al into the silicate portion of the body during
              differentiation and large early surface heat fluxes, followed by a
              brief period (<12.5 Myr for bodies with radii <500 km) of
              thermally-driven dynamo activity as heat is convected from the
              core across a partially-molten magma ocean. We also expect that
              gradual core solidification produced compositionally-driven dynamo
              activity in these bodies, the timing of which could vary by tens
              to hundreds of millions of years depending on the S concentration
              of the core and the radius of the body. There was likely a pause
              in core cooling and dynamo activity following the cessation of
              convection in the magma ocean. Our predicted periods of magnetic
              field generation and quiescence match eras of high and low
              paleointensities in the asteroid magnetic field record compiled
              from paleomagnetic measurements of multiple meteorites, providing
              the possible origins of the remanent magnetisations carried by
              these samples. We also compare our predictions to paleomagnetic

              problem in the Moon's evolution. Theoretical work invoking a core
              dynamo has been unable to explain the magnitude of the observed
              field, falling instead one to two orders of magnitude below it.
              Since surface magnetic field strength is highly sensitive to the
              depth and size of the dynamo region, we instead hypothesize that
              the early lunar dynamo was driven by convection in a basal magma
              ocean formed from the final stages of an early lunar magma ocean;
              this material is expected to be dense, radioactive, and

              the longevity and heat flow of such a basal magma ocean and use

              Moon has a small metallic core, yet the composition of the core is
              poorly constrained. The physical state of the core (now or in the
              past) depends on detailed knowledge of its composition, and
              unfortunately, there is little available data on relevant
              multicomponent systems (i.e., Fe–Ni–S–C) at lunar interior
              conditions. In particular, there is a dearth of phase equilibrium
              data to elucidate whether a specific core composition could help
              to explain an early lunar geodynamo and magnetic field
              intensities, or current solid inner core/liquid outer core states.
              We utilize geochemical information to estimate the Ni, S and C
              contents of the lunar core, and then carry out phase equilibria
              experiments on several possible core compositions at the pressure
              and temperature conditions relevant to the lunar interior. The
              first composition is 0.5 wt\% S and 0.375 wt\% C, based on S and C
              contents of Apollo glasses. A second composition contains 1 wt\%
              each of S and C, and assumes that the lunar mantle experienced
              degassing of up to 50\% of its S and C. Finally a third
              composition contains C as the dominant light element. Phase
              equilibrium experiments were completed at 1, 3 and 5 GPa, using
              piston cylinder and multi-anvil techniques. The first composition
              has a liquidus near 1550 °C and solidus near 1250 °C. The second
              composition has a narrower liquidus and solidus temperatures of
              1400 and 1270 °C, respectively, while the third composition is
              molten down to 1150 °C. As the composition crystallizes, the
              residual liquid becomes enriched in S and C, but S enrichment is
              greater due to the incorporation of C (but not S) into solid
              metallic FeNi. Comparison of these results to thermal models for
              the Moon allow an evaluation of which composition is consistent
              with the geophysical data of an early dynamo and a currently solid
              inner and liquid outer core. Composition 1 has a high enough
              liquidus to start crystallizing early in lunar history (4.3 Ga),
              consistent with the possible core dynamo initiated by
              crystallization of a solid inner core. Composition 1 also stays
              partially molten throughout lunar history, and could easily
              explain the seismic data. Composition 2, on the other hand, can
              satisfy one or the other set of geophysical data, but not both and
              thus seems like a poor candidate for a lunar core composition.
              Composition 3 remains molten to temperatures that are lower than
              current estimates for the lunar core, thus ruling out the
              possibility of a C-rich (and S-poor) lunar core. The S- and C-poor
              core composition studied here (composition 1) is consistent with
              all available geochemical and geophysical data and provides a
              simple heat source and mechanism for a lunar core dynamo (core
              crystallization) that would obviate the need for other primary
              mechanisms such as impacts, core–mantle coupling, or unusual

               is controlled by thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and
               density, which are functions of temperature (T). We investigate
               if the incorporation of the T-dependence of thermal properties
               and the introduction of a nonlinear term to the heat equation
               could result in different interpretations of the origin of
               different classes of meteorites. We have developed a finite
               difference code to perform numerical models of a conductively
               cooling planetesimal with T-dependent properties and find that
               including T-dependence produces considerable differences in
               thermal history, and in turn the estimated timing and depth of
               meteorite genesis. We interrogate the effects of varying the

               crystallization and dynamo activity by ?40 Myr, approximately
               equivalent to increasing the planetary radius by 10\%, and extend

               substantial core, we will never be able to sample it.
               Fortunately, asteroid collisions provide us with a rich sampling
               of the deep interiors of differentiated asteroids. Iron and
               stony-iron meteorites are fragments of a large number of
               asteroids that underwent significant geological processing in the
               early solar system. Parent bodies of iron and some stony-iron
               meteorites completed a geological evolution similar to that
               continuing on Earth – although on much smaller length- and
               timescales – with melting of the metal and silicates;
               differentiation into core, mantle, and crust; and probably
               extensive volcanism. Iron and stony-iron meteorites are our only
               available analogues to materials found in the deep interiors of

               System. Lunar samples, planetary cratering records and dynamical
               models piece together an increasingly coherent view of this
               bombardment interval. During the first billion years of Solar
               System evolution, following planetary accretion, the rate of
               impact cratering was substantially higher than over the past 3.5
               Gyr. However, the causes, magnitude and evolution of the early
               impact flux remain unknown. In particular, uncertainty persists
               about whether the largest impact basins on the Moon and the other
               terrestrial planets formed from a cataclysmic bombardment in a
               narrow window of time about 3.9 Gyr ago, as initially suggested
               by the lunar sample collection, or over a more extended period.
               Recent observations relating to this so-called Late Heavy
               Bombardment imply that the window of bombardment was not as
               narrow and intense as originally envisaged. Nevertheless,
               numerical simulations suggest that the rocky bodies left behind
               after planetary accretion are insufficient in number to form the
               youngest large impact basins 4.0 to 3.7 Gyr ago. One viable
               hypothesis for the formation of these basins is the delivery of
               impactors to the inner Solar System following the migration of
               the giant planets, but this scenario also faces challenges.
               Clarifying the magnitude and length of the Late Heavy Bombardment
               has implications across the full range of planetary geosciences,
               from understanding the dynamical evolution of the Solar System to

              enable technologies ranging from pharmaceuticals production to

              gravitational instabilities in granular particle mixtures subject
              to vertical vibration and upward gas flow, including a
              Rayleigh–Taylor (RT)-like instability in which lighter grains rise
              through heavier grains in the form of “fingers” and “granular
              bubbles.” We demonstrate that this RT-like instability arises due
              to a competition between upward drag force increased locally by
              gas channeling and downward contact forces, and thus the physical
              mechanism is entirely different from that found in liquids. This
              gas channeling mechanism also generates other gravitational
              instabilities: the rise of a granular bubble which leaves a trail
              of particles behind it and the cascading branching of a descending

               unique sample from the deep interiors of solar system parent
               bodies. They contain evidence of the former existence of one or
               more residual melts. Olivine is a major phase. Its primary shape
               is rounded; the angular crystals in many pallasites are
               secondary. Tubular inclusions are widespread. They perhaps are
               the residence of CO2, released during laboratory heating
               experiments. Phosphoran olivine, a new variety of olivine
               containing 4–5 wt\% P2O5, occurs in a few pallasites. Its Fe/Mg
               ratio is apparently independent of the host olivine composition.
               Pyroxene (not previously described from pallasites) occurs in
               symplectic intergrowths in seven meteorites. Compositionally, it
               lies in the gap between pyroxenes in chondrites and most irons.
               There are two groups: Fs11.6 ± 0.2 and Fs16.7 ± 0.2 The pyroxene
               contains exceptionally low Ca (< 0.1–0.2 wt\%) and there is an
               indication of an inverse relation between Fe and Ca. Modal
               analyses and density measurements were made on all available
               specimens and bulk compositions were calculated. The ‘average’
               pallasite contains 65 vol. \% olivine and 50.5 wt \% total Fe.
               Many of the densities of pallasites cluster around that
               calculated for close-packed olivine. Pallasites are exotic
               cumulates. Their textures resemble terrestrial cumulates, as does
               the presence of olivine and chromite. The metal texture resembles
               a solidified intercumulus liquid. Those pallasites containing
               olivine in excess of close-packing were subjected to adcumulus
               growth, thereby also explaining the widespread mutual borders.
               There is abundant evidence of deformation. For olivines this
               includes their fragmental shape and kink banding. Troilite formed
               a eutectic-like melt with kamacite: pieces of spalled olivine and
               schreibersite were injected into and captured by this melt.
               Troilite polycrystallinity resulted from the deformation. This
               deformation occurred while the pallasites were still deeply
               buried, resulting in incipient spheroidization of olivine
               fragments, including the formation of elongate, rounded crystals.
               A later, lower temperature deformation disrupted plessite.
               Pallasites formed in multiple parent bodies by processes that
               recurred in several places within the solar system, as shown by
               the mineralogical and textural similarities between pallasites
               that differ in their isotopic and trace element compositions.
               Type IIIB irons still seem the most likely associated meteorites.

               main-group pallasites (PMG), widely held to be samples of a
               core–mantle interface. Most PMG cluster in a narrow range of
               metal and silicate compositions, but 6 are assigned to an
               anomalous subset (PMG-am) because of their deviant metal
               compositions, and 4 others to another anomalous subset (PMG-as)
               because of their appreciably higher olivine Fa contents. Metal
               compositions in all PMG are closely related to those in evolved
               IIIAB irons, and are generally consistent with their formation in
               the IIIAB parent asteroid. On element-Au diagrams for
               incompatible elements the normal PMG plot near an extrapolation
               of IIIAB trends to higher Au concentrations. On element-Au plots
               of compatible elements such as Ir or Pt the loci of PMG spread
               out over a broader region explainable by mixing of evolved IIIAB
               magma with early-crystallized core or mantle-residue solids. Two
               features of PMG require special models: (1) Ga and Ge contents
               are generally high (≈1.5×) compared to the IIIAB-based mixing
               model: and (2) the FeO/(FeO + MgO) ratios span a surprisingly
               wide range, from 0.11–0.14 in normal PMG to 0.16 to 0.18 in
               PMG-as This range is larger than expected in a cumulate layer at
               the base of a mantle. We suggest that both features may be
               related to the interaction of PMG precursors with a highly
               evolved magmatic gas phase, and that some or all of these
               anomalies may have resulted from vapor deposits in voids near the
               core–mantle interface. An important boundary condition for
               understanding the detailed PMG origin at the core–mantle
               interface is the large difference between the solidus temperature
               of Fa11 olivine (≈2000 K) and the liquidus temperature of an
               evolved IIIAB melt containing >100 mg/g S and some P (≈1600 K).
               Following the mixing event that formed the PMG it is therefore
               reasonable that there would have been olivine rubble floating on
               top of the IIIAB-like magma, but with appreciable void space
               present just above the upper level reached by the magma. These
               voids would have contained gases released from the magma during
               its flow into the PMG region. We suggest that Ga and Ge, the two
               most volatile siderophiles in our element set, were added to PMG
               metal from the magmatic gas. We also suggest that the magmatic
               gas was oxidizing and that the PMG having high olivine fayalite
               contents formed in regions where the ratio of void to olivine was
               high, and that some metallic Fe was oxidized and entered the
               olivine (or the phosphoran olivine). In support of the latter
               idea is the observation that both Ni and Co are elevated in the
               PMG-as (Fa≥16) compared to values predicted by IIIAB trends. We
               analyzed two Eagle-Station pallasites (PES); after correction for
               weathering effects in Cold Bay, its composition is found to
               closely resemble that of Eagle Station but to represent a more
               evolved composition (i.e., lower Ir, higher Au). Vermillion and
               Yamato 8451 have been called pyroxene pallasites but have metal
               compositions (unrelated to those of the PMG or PES) that are too
               different from each other to even allow assignment to the same
               grouplet.",

              by development of computer program, which enables automatic crack
              analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs.
              Micromechanical tests of pneumatic ventricular assist devices
              result in a large number of micrographs. Therefore, the analysis
              must be automatic. Tests for athrombogenic titanium nitride/gold
              coatings deposited on polymeric substrates (Bionate II) are
              performed. These tests include microshear, microtension and
              fatigue analysis. Anisotropic surface defects observed in the SEM
              micrographs require support for qualitative and quantitative
              interpretation. Improvement of qualitative analysis of scanning
              electron microscope images was achieved by a set of computational
              tools that includes binarization, simplified expanding, expanding,
              simple image statistic thresholding, the filters Laplacian 1, and
              Laplacian 2, Otsu and reverse binarization. Several modifications
              of the known image processing techniques and combinations of the
              selected image processing techniques were applied. The introduced
              quantitative analysis of digital scanning electron microscope

              area, crack angle, crack length, and total crack length per unit

              kamacite-taenite structures formed in situ, after the presently

              solid silicates and metal. Metal structures and compositional

              of olivine and metal compositions, although mesosiderites do
              appear to be genetically related to eucrites and howardites. The
              genetic history of mesosiderites is very complex and includes a
              significant change in cooling environment. An evolutionary model
              is described which includes magmatic differentiation, followed by
              brecciation, metal-silicate mixing, insulation by burial,
              metamorphism, and, ultimately, removal from the parent body.
              Mesosiderites are a distinct group, which, aside from the
              similarities and genetic relationship to Ca-rich achondrites,
              appear to have no affinities to other meteorite types.",

               history. These bodies should have had well-developed olivine-rich
               mantles and consequentially such materials ought to be abundant
               both as asteroids and meteorites, which they are not. To
               investigate this “Great Dunite Shortage” we have undertaken a
               geochemical and oxygen isotope study of main-group pallasites and
               dunitic rocks from mesosiderites. Oxygen isotope analysis of 24
               main-group pallasites (103 replicates) yielded a mean Δ17O value
               of −0.187±0.016‰ (2σ), which is fully resolved from the HED Δ17O
               value of −0.246±0.014 (2σ) obtained in our earlier study and
               demonstrates that both groups represent distinct populations and
               were derived from separate parent bodies. Our results show no
               evidence for Δ17O bimodality within the main-group pallasites, as
               suggested by a number of previous studies. Olivine-rich materials
               from the Vaca Muerta, Mount Padbury and Lamont mesosiderites, and
               from two related dunites (NWA 2968 and NWA 3329), have Δ17O
               values within error of the mesosiderite average. This indicates
               that these olivine-rich materials are co-genetic with other
               mesosiderite clasts and are not fragments from an isotopically
               distinct pallasite-like impactor. Despite its extreme lithologic
               diversity the mesosiderite parent body was essentially
               homogeneous with respect to Δ17O, a feature best explained by an
               early phase of large-scale melting (magma ocean), followed by
               prolonged igneous differentiation. Based on the results of magma
               ocean modeling studies, we infer that Mg-rich olivines in
               mesosiderites formed as cumulates in high-level chambers and do
               not represent samples of the underlying mantle. By analogy,
               recently documented Mg-rich olivines in howardites may have a
               similar origin. Although the Dawn mission did not detect
               mesosiderite-like material on Vesta, evidence linking the
               mesosiderites and HEDs includes: (i) their nearly identical
               oxygen isotope compositions; (ii) the presence in both of
               coarse-grained Mg-rich olivines; (iii) both have synchronous
               Lu-Hf and Mn-Cr ages; (iv) there are compositional similarities
               between the metal in both; and (v) mesosiderite-like material has
               been identified in a howardite breccia. The source of the
               mesosiderites remains an outstanding question in meteorite
               science. The underrepresentation of olivine-rich materials
               amongst both asteroids and meteorites results from a range of
               factors. However, evidence from pallasites and mesosiderites
               indicates that the most important reason for this olivine
               shortage lies in the early, catastrophic destruction of
               planetesimals in the terrestrial planet-forming region and the
               subsequent preferential loss of their olivine-rich mantles.",

              fusion and the formation of deep magma oceans. Here we report a
              study of oxygen isotopes in two basaltic meteorite suites, the
              HEDs (howardites, eucrites and diogenites, which are thought to
              sample the asteroid 4 Vesta) and the angrites (from an
              unidentified asteroidal source). Our results demonstrate that
              these meteorite suites formed during early, global-scale melting
              (> or = 50 per cent) events. We show that magma oceans were
              present on all the differentiated Solar System bodies so far
              sampled. Magma oceans produced compositionally layered
              planetesimals; the modification of such bodies before
              incorporation into larger objects can explain some anomalous
              planetary features, such as Earth's high Mg/Si ratio.",

              shock metamorphism in sixteen mesosiderites and find that none
              have been shocked to more than 10 GPa (shock stage S1–S2). Three
              mesosiderites contain a tiny fraction (≈0.1 \% overall) of mineral
              fragments that were shocked to shock stage S3–S6 levels. The
              uniformity of shock features within all fragments shows that these
              fragments were not shocked in situ. Our shock data for
              mesosiderites, the absence of evidence of 3.6–3.9 Gy impact melt,
              the shock history of impact-heated ordinary chondrites, and the
              difficulty in quantitatively removing Ar in an impact event, all
              suggest that the mesosiderite parent body did not suffer a major
              impact event 3.6–3.9 Gy ago. Metallographic cooling rates of
              ≈0.03°C/My at 400°C were estimated from taenite lamellae in four
              mesosiderites using the latest diffusion coefficients and FeNiP
              phase diagram. Cooling rates of 0.01°C / My at 425–325°C were
              estimated from published compositional data for kamacite grains in
              four mesosiderites. These two techniques and four other
              semiquantitative, metallographic cooling rate indicators show that
              the mesosiderites cooled slower than any iron meteorite. We infer
              that cooling rates at 400°C were ∼0.02–0.03°C/My and certainly
              less than 0.5°C/My. The inferred cooling rate is too slow to allow
              Ar closure before 4 Gy. All of the shock, thermal, and age data
              for mesosiderites are consistent with slow cooling at depth < 1 My
              after metal and silicate were mixed around 4.4 Gy ago. Thermal
              models indicate that the mesosiderites probably cooled in an
              asteroid some 200–400 km in radius.",

               stony-iron meteorites that formed by the mixing of

               and provide unique insights into the catastrophic break-up of

               process and the poorly constrained timing of metal–silicate
               mixing complicate the assignment to potential parent bodies. Here
               we report the high-precision uranium–lead dating of mesosiderite
               zircons by isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry
               to reveal an initial crust formation 4,558.5 ± 2.1 million years
               ago and metal–silicate mixing at 4,525.39 ± 0.85 million years

               formation and a large-scale reheating event on the eucrite parent
               body, probably the asteroid Vesta. This chronological coincidence

               the Solar System is 0.34–1.91 million years older than previously

               surrounding the proto-Sun. This age is estimated by dating
               calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions in meteorites. These inclusions
               are considered as the earliest formed solids in the solar nebula.
               Their formation marks the beginning for several long- and
               short-lived radiogenic clocks that are used to precisely define
               the timescales of Solar System events, such as the formation and

               the oldest age obtained for any Solar System object so far. We
               also determined the 26Al–26Mg model age of this inclusion, and

               the earliest stage of metal culture. Advances in metallographic
               analysis techniques have revealed that meteoric iron largely
               comprises kamacite, taenite, and cohenite, which correspond to
               ferrite, austenite, and cementite in artificial steel,
               respectively. Although the mechanical properties of meteoric
               irons were measured previously to understand their origin and
               history, the genuine mechanical properties of meteoric iron
               remain unknown because of its complex microstructure and the
               pre-existing cracks in cohenite. Using micro-tensile tests to
               analyse the single-crystalline constituents of the Canyon Diablo
               meteorite, herein, we show that the taenite matrix exhibits
               excellent balance between yield strength and ductility superior
               to that of the kamacite matrix. We found that taenite is rich in
               nitrogen despite containing a large amount of nickel, which
               decreases the nitrogen solubility, suggesting that solid-solution
               strengthening via nitrogen is highly effective for the Fe-Ni
               system. Our findings not only provide insights for developing
               advanced high-strength steel but also help understand the
               mysterious relationship between nitrogen and nickel contents in
               steel. Like ancient peoples believed that meteoric iron was a
               gift from the heavens, the findings herein imply that this

               produce macroscopic twins which are subsequently decorated by the
               precipitation of kamacite. In addition, the stresses which arise
               by virtue of the volume changes during the precipitation of
               kamacite may produce transformation twins on a microscopic scale
               within the kamacite. These transformation twins appear similar to
               partially annealed Neumann lines and are decorated by the
               subsequent precipitation of rhabdite. Decorated transformation
               twins are usually accompanied by a later generation of fresh or

              considered surprising in the light of early work where crack
              nucleation in persistent slip bands seemed to be the rule. To
              investigate the causes of this behavior, studies habe been carried
              out on polycrystalline copper with emphasis on the following
              factors: grain size (Part I), method of starting the test,
              frequency and mode of test control (Part II). The results show
              that the cyclic plasticity is the controlling factor in grain
              boundary initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks. It was
              found that transgranular cracking can be produced by factors which
              promote strain localization, and reducing the grain size of the
              specimens in constant-amplitude tests is one of them. In
              small-grain-sized metals, most of the applied plastic strain is
              concentrated in a few persistent slip bands, some of which develop

              structures causes strain homogenization and therefore
              intergranular cracking. For coarse-grained copper, a step is
              gradually built up at a sensitive grain boundary as a result of
              the “homogeneous” cyclic slip, at which point the cracking occurs

               with triaxially constrained external boundaries. Thermal stress
               crack instability occurs between two values of critical crack
               length. For short initial crack length, crack propagation occurs
               kinetically, with the total area of crack propagation
               proportional to the factor St2 (1-2v)/EG, where St is tensile
               strength, v is Poisson's ratio, E is Young's modulus, and G is
               surface fracture energy. Under these conditions the newly formed
               crack is subcritical and requires a finite increase in
               temperature difference before propagation will proceed. For long
               initial crack length, crack propagation occurs in a quasi-static

              I, mixed mode I/II and mode II) and under a quasi-static and
              dynamic strain rate is still a big challenge due to the
              difficulties associated with measuring this parameter. Taking into

              applications in the scientific and practical life, series tests
              were conducted on rectangular specimens of this rock type under a
              quasi-static and dynamic strain rate by using a servo hydraulic
              machine and drop weight machine, respectively. A special electric
              circuit was designed in this study to investigate the effect of
              the loading mode and strain rate on the crack propagation speed.
              Crack propagation speed was measured under six strain rates (6 ×
              10-4, 6 × 10-3, 6 × 10-2, 1.9 × 10+1, 3.8 × 10+1 and 5.6 × 10+1

              crack propagation speed depends on the loading mode and strain
              rate. By increasing the strain rate from 6 × 10-4 to 5.6 × 10+1
              S-1, the average crack propagation speed under pure mode I, mixed
              mode loading I/II and pure mode II increases by 12, 4.6 and 4.1
              times, respectively. The crack propagation speed under pure mode I
              and mixed mode loading I/II almost has the same increment rate.
              But the increment rate of the crack propagation speed under pure
              mode II is slightly larger. For pure mode I, no significant
              changes were observed on the crack propagation path by increasing
              the strain rate. For mixed mode I/II and pure mode II, the crack
              propagation path under a quasi-static strain rate was a
              traditional concave-up path. While under a dynamic strain rate,

              deceleration, and (2) fracture resistance to grow under two
              loading modes (pure mode I and pure mode II) was investigated for
              both brittle and ductile rocks. The ductile type was mudstone,
              which is a clay-rich rock with a high affinity for water. While
              the brittle type was granite, which does not contain water-active
              minerals such as clay or lime. Eighteen semi-circular specimens of
              mudstone and granite were prepared and tested at room temperature
              (RT), 250 and 500 °C. The results showed one behavioral trend for
              the effect of temperature on the mudstone. Due to the drying of
              clay minerals by increasing the temperature, the crack speed and
              fracture toughness improved significantly under pure mode I and II
              after thermal treatment. On the other hand, the thermal treatment
              of granite caused two behavioral trends. The first trend shows
              that crack speed and fracture toughness increased under pure mode
              I and II by increasing the temperature from RT to 250 °C due to
              crack arrest by randomly distributed thermal microcracks. In the
              second trend, they decreased below their normal levels under
              treatment from room temperature to T = 500 °C due to the extension
              and coalescence of thermal microcracks. The granite behavior
              changes depending on the density and extension of thermal
              microcracks. Under the three temperatures of RT, 250, and 500 °C,
              and for the two rock types, crack propagation speed, crack
              acceleration, and deceleration under pure mode II were greater
              than that under pure mode I. Where the fracture goes through three
              main stages growth, high acceleration, high deceleration, and low
              deceleration stages. In addition, the effect of temperature on the
              fracture toughness ratio (KIIC/KIC) was evaluated and the results
              showed that increasing the temperature increased the fracture
              toughness ratio. This means that after thermal treatment, the
              improvement rate of fracture toughness under pure mode II is
              better than that under pure mode I, and the crack tends to grow
              under pure mode I rather than mode II.",

              radiography. Here we revisit the viscosity of liquid Fe and FeS up
              to 6.4 GPa using recently developed ultrafast X-ray imaging. In
              this study, we imaged the falling spheres at a rate of
              500frames/s, which is around 10 times faster than previous

               transmission electron microscopy. Textural evidence of silicate
               liquid immiscibility includes droplets of one glass disseminated
               in a chemically distinct glassy matrix; sharp phase boundaries
               (menisci) between the two glasses; deformation and coalescence of
               droplets; and occurrence of secondary, nanometer-sized quench
               droplets in Si-rich glasses. The compositions of the conjugate
               immiscible liquids (Si-rich and Fe-rich) are consistent with
               phase separation in two-liquid fields in the general system
               Fe2SiO4?KAlSi3O8?SiO2?CaO?MgO?TiO2?P2O5. Major-element partition
               coefficients are well correlated with the degree of
               polymerization (NBO/T) of the Si-rich melt: Fe, Ca, Mg, and Ti
               are concentrated in the poorly polymerized, Fe-rich melt, whereas
               K, Na, and Si prefer the highly polymerized, Si-rich melt.
               Partitioning of Al is less pronounced and depends on bulk melt
               composition. Thus, major element partitioning between the
               conjugate liquids closely follows trends known from tholeiitic
               basalts, lunar basalts, and experimental analogs. The
               characteristics of impact melt inhomogeneity produced by melt
               unmixing in a miscibility gap are then compared to impact melt
               inhomogeneity caused by incomplete homogenization of different
               (miscible or immiscible) impact melts that result from shock
               melting of different target lithologies from the crater's melt
               zone, which do not fully homogenize and equilibrate due to rapid
               quenching. By taking previous reports on silicate emulsions in
               impact glasses into account, it follows that silicate impact
               melts of variable composition, cooling rate, and crystallization
               history might readily unmix during cooling, thereby rendering
               silicate liquid immiscibility a much more common process in the

               impact of the Gebel Kamil iron meteorite on a sedimentary target,
               namely layered sandstones with subhorizontal bedding. We have
               carried out a petrographic study of samples from the crater wall
               and ejecta deposits collected during our first geophysical
               campaign (February 2010) in order to investigate shock effects
               recorded in these rocks. Ejecta samples reveal a wide range of
               shock features common in quartz-rich target rocks. They have been
               divided into two categories, as a function of their abundance at
               thin section scale: (1) pervasive shock features (the most
               abundant), including fracturing, planar deformation features, and
               impact melt lapilli and bombs, and (2) localized shock features
               (the least abundant) including high-pressure phases and localized
               impact melting in the form of intergranular melt, melt veins, and
               melt films in shatter cones. In particular, Kamil crater is the
               smallest impact crater where shatter cones, coesite, stishovite,
               diamond, and melt veins have been reported. Based on experimental
               calibrations reported in the literature, pervasive shock features
               suggest that the maximum shock pressure was between 30 and 60
               GPa. Using the planar impact approximation, we calculate a
               vertical component of the impact velocity of at least 3.5 km s?1.
               The wide range of shock features and their freshness make Kamil a

               the liquid phase. Our results indicate that the melt migration is
               caused by two mechanisms. In the first mechanism, a change in
               melt fraction is accommodated by compaction/decompaction of solid
               matrix, and in the second mechanism, a change in melt fraction is
               accommodated by dissolution/precipitation. The latter mechanism
               is newly introduced in this study. As spatial scale decreases,
               the dominant mechanism changes from compaction/decompaction to
               dissolution/precipitation, and when the second mechanism is
               dominant, evolution of melt fraction is governed by a nonlinear
               diffusion equation. Therefore, critical scale of this transition
               is called “diffusion length δd” below which melt fraction evolves
               primarily by diffusion. Diffusion length δd is usually smaller

              When the water flows through the fractures, it imbibes into the
              matrix and pushes the oil out of the pores due to the difference
              in the capillary pressure. In this paper, we focus on modeling and

              (MFD) approach coupled with discrete fracture/discrete matrix

              different wetting states of the porous media (i.e., varying

              complicates the adaptation of microscopic theories from atomic,

               meteorites which can be assigned to the same parent body allows
               us to derive general characteristics of the parent body, such as
               its size and formation time, which hold important clues on the
               planetary formation process. This requires us to construct a
               detailed model of the heating of such a body by short lived
               radioactives, in particular by 26Al, and its cooling by heat
               conduction, which may then be compared to the reconstructed
               cooling histories of the meteorites.Aims. The heat conductivity
               of the material from which planetesimals are composed depends
               critically on the porosity of the chondritic material. This
               changes during the process of compaction (also called sintering)
               of the material at elevated temperatures and pressures.
               Therefore, compaction of an initially granular material is a key
               process determining the thermal history of the parent bodies of
               meteorites. The most realistic modelling of sintering of
               chondritic material is required.Methods. The modelling of the
               compaction process is improved by applying concepts originally
               developed for the modelling of hot isostatic pressing in
               metallurgical processes, and by collecting data available from
               geosciences for the materials of interest. It is extended to a
               binary mixture of granular components of very different diameters
               – matrix and chondrules – as observed in chondrites. Results. By
               comparison with some published data on sintering experiments it
               is shown that the algorithm to follow the decrease of porosity of
               granular material during progressive sintering allows a
               sufficiently accurate modelling of the compaction of silicate
               material. The dependence of the compaction process on the nature
               of the precursor material, either matrix-dominated or
               chondrule-dominated, is discussed. It is shown that the
               characteristic temperature at which sintering occurs is different
               for matrix or chondrule-dominated precursor material. We apply
               the new method for calculating compaction to the evolution of the
               parent body of the H chondrites and determine an improved
               optimised set of model parameters for this body. Conclusions.",

               To optimize the accuracy and speed of reconstruction, the

               refinement, orientation coalescence, and regional voting.
               Martensitic stainless steels with/without retained austenite were
               used to demonstrate this approach. The reconstruction parameters
               can be determined theoretically or semi-theoretically in this
               algorithm. Moreover, mis-indexing near the twinning boundaries of
               prior austenite is minimized in the regional voting process.

              on Fe-Ni-P alloys are combined to determine the effect of P on the

              results, two reaction paths were found for the formation of
              kamacite (1) γ (taenite) → α (kamacite) + γ (taenite) and (2) γ →
              γ + Ph (phosphide, (FeNi)3P) → α + γ + Ph. The reaction path γ → α
              + γ is preferred at low P contents while at higher P contents and
              at Ni contents greater than 7·0 wt. \%, the reaction path γ → γ +
              Ph → α + γ + Ph controls the formation of kamacite. Above 7 wt. \%
              Ni, the effect of P on the equilibrium nucleation temperature of
              kamacite is quite small, less than about ± 30°C with respect to
              the Fe-Ni binary diagram. We were able to produce kamacite during
              direct cooling of alloys of meteoritic composition containing as
              little as 0·1 wt. \% P. This is the first report of a successful
              synthesis of the Widmanstätten pattern. Kamacite nucleates
              initially at prior taenite grain boundaries with little or no
              undercooling. A Widmanstätten pattern was produced in many of
              these same alloys only after undercooling 30 to more than 100°C
              below the equilibrium nucleation temperature. The addition of P (>
              0·1 wt.\%) to meteorites promotes nucleation of kamacite at higher
              temperatures and effectively lowers the amount of undercooling
              necessary to nucleate kamacite homogeneously. Ni has just the
              opposite effect, decreasing the temperature of nucleation and
              increasing the amount of undercooling. Our experimental results
              indicate that (1) significant amounts of undercooling, 50–100°C,
              are necessary for the nucleation of the Widmanstätten structure in
              meteorites, and (2) chemical equilibrium is maintained in the
              various phases of slowly cooled iron meteorites to 650°C and
              probably to 600°C. The effect of P on the cooling rate
              calculations for iron meteorites and pallasites appears to be
              small, that is within the factor of 2 error currently ascribed to
              the method. Since the amount of P determines the Ni content of
              kamacite in equilibrium with taenite, one can no longer use the
              binary phase diagram and the measured Ni contents at
              kamacite/taenite interfaces to obtain the lowest equilibrium
              temperature during cooling.",

              Light optical microscopy (LOM) and electron backscatter
              diffraction (EBSD) analysis were employed to analyze phases.
              Samples were either mechanically or electrolytically polished to
              study the effect of the preparation technique. Mechanical
              polishing produced up to 26\% strain-induced martensite.
              Electrolytic polishing with 150 g citric acid, 300 g distilled
              water, 600 mL H3PO4, and 450 mL H2SO4 resulted in martensite free
              surfaces, providing high-quality samples for EBSD analysis.
              Martensite identification was challenging both with LOM, due to
              the similar etching response of ferrite and martensite, and with
              EBSD, due to the similar lattice structures of ferrite and

               half-lives to resolve the ages of meteorites and their components
               formed in the first 5Myr of the Solar System. This paper reviews
               the theory and methods behind this chronometer, offers criteria

               current state and immediate future of the chronometry of the
               early Solar System. We recognize that there is some debate over
               the age of the Solar System, but conclude that an age of
               4567.30±0.16Ma based on four CAIs dated individually by the same
               method in two different laboratories is presently the best
               constrained published value. We further conclude that nebular
               chondrules dated by the Pb–Pb method require that they formed
               contemporaneously with CAIs and continued to form for at least
               ∼4Myr, a conclusion that implies heterogeneous distribution of
               the short-lived 26Al nuclide in the protoplanetary disk.
               Planetesimals were already forming by ∼1Myr after CAI formation,
               consistent with their growth predominantly through the accretion
               of chondrules. Nebular chondrule formation was completed by ∼5Myr
               after CAI formation when the impact-generated Cba chondrules
               formed after the disk was cleared of gas and dust. We note that
               the absolute age of the Solar System or any single early Solar
               System object is not fundamental to any significant scientific
               question and that it is important only to know the correct

               of early solar system processes requires the precise knowledge of
               the initial Hf and W isotope compositions of the solar system. To
               determine these values, we investigated the Hf–W isotopic
               systematics of bulk samples and mineral separates from several
               Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the CV3 chondrites Allende and
               NWA 2364. Most of the investigated CAIs have relative proportions
               of 183W, 184W, and 186W that are indistinguishable from those of
               bulk chondrites and the terrestrial standard. In contrast, one of
               the investigated Allende CAIs has a lower 184W/183W ratio, most
               likely reflecting an overabundance of r-process relative to
               s-process isotopes of W. All other bulk CAIs have similar
               180Hf/184W and 182W/184W ratios that are elevated relative to
               average carbonaceous chondrites, probably reflecting Hf–W
               fractionation in the solar nebula within the first ∼3Myr. The
               limited spread in 180Hf/184W ratios among the bulk CAIs precludes
               determination of a CAI whole-rock isochron but the fassaites have
               high 180Hf/184W and radiogenic 182W/184W ratios up to ∼14ε units
               higher than the bulk rock. This makes it possible to obtain
               precise internal Hf–W isochrons for CAIs. There is evidence of
               disturbed Hf–W systematics in one of the CAIs but all other
               investigated CAIs show no detectable effects of parent body
               processes such as alteration and thermal metamorphism. Except for
               two fractions from one Allende CAI, all fractions from the
               investigated CAIs plot on a single well-defined isochron, which
               defines the initial ε182W=−3.28±0.12 and
               182Hf/180Hf=(9.72±0.44)×10−5 at the time of CAI formation. The
               initial 182Hf/180Hf and 26Al/27Al ratios of the angrites
               D’Orbigny and Sahara 99555 are consistent with the decay from
               initial abundances of 182Hf and 26Al as measured in CAIs,
               suggesting that these two nuclides were homogeneously distributed
               throughout the solar system. However, the uncertainties on the
               initial 182Hf/180Hf and 26Al/27Al ratios are too large to exclude
               that some 26Al in CAIs was produced locally by particle
               irradiation close to an early active Sun. The initial 182Hf/180Hf
               of CAIs corresponds to an absolute age of 4568.3±0.7Ma, which may
               be defined as the age of the solar system. This age is 0.5–2Myr
               older than the most precise 207Pb–206Pb age of Efremovka CAI 60,
               which does not seem to date CAI formation. Tungsten model ages
               for magmatic iron meteorites, calculated relative to the newly
               and more precisely defined initial ε182W of CAIs, indicate that
               core formation in their parent bodies occurred in less than ∼1Myr
               after CAI formation. This confirms earlier conclusions that the
               accretion of the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites
               predated chondrule formation and that their differentiation was
               triggered by heating from decay of abundant 26Al. A more precise
               dating of core formation in iron meteorite parent bodies requires
               precise quantification of cosmic-ray effects on W isotopes but
               this has not been established yet.",

              assumed to be invariant in all U–Pb dating of meteorites so far,
              but the recent discovery of U isotope variations in CAIs
              (Brennecka et al., 2010a) shows that this assumption is invalid.
              We present the first combined high-precision U and Pb isotopic
              data for a CAI, and U isotopic data for chondrules and whole rock
              fractions of the Allende meteorite. The Pb–Pb isochron age of the

              238U/235U=137.837 of the CRM 145 standard. Our best current
              estimate of the average terrestrial value is:
              238U/235U=137.821±0.014.The error in the age includes
              uncertainties in the Pb–Pb isochron intercept and in the 238U/235U

              238U/235U=137.747±0.017 (2σ), distinctly lower than the CAI. The
              difference in the 238U/235U ratio of 0.129±0.046 (2σ) between the
              CAI and chondrules and bulk meteorite increases the 207Pb–206Pb
              age difference by ~1.4Ma, and eliminates apparent disagreement

               circumvent the “radial-drift barrier”, i.e. the accretion of dust
               particles onto the central star by radial migration. The outcome
               of the dust radial migration is governed by simple criteria
               between the dust-to-gas ratio and the exponents p and q of the
               surface density and temperature power laws. The transfer of
               radiation provides an additional constraint between these
               quantities because the disc thermal structure is fixed by the
               dust spatial distribution. To assess which discs are primarily
               affected by the radial-drift barrier, we used the radiative
               transfer code MCFOST to compute the temperature structure of a
               wide range of disc models, stressing the particular effects of
               grain size distributions and vertical settling. We find that the
               outcome of the dust migration process is very sensitive to the
               physical conditions within the disc. For high dust-to-gas ratios
               (≳0.01) and/or flattened disc structures (H/R ≲ 0.05), growing
               dust grains can efficiently decouple from the gas, leading to a
               high concentration of grains at a critical radius of a few AU.
               Decoupling of grains from gas can occur at a large fraction
               (>0.1) of the initial radius of the particle, for a dust-to-gas
               ratio greater than ≈0.05. Dust grains that experience migration
               without significant growth (millimetre and centimetre-sized) are
               efficiently accreted for discs with flat surface density profiles
               (p p > 1.2). Between (0.7 p < 1.2), both behaviours may occur
               depending on the exact density and temperature structures of the
               disc. Both the presence of large grains and vertical settling
               tend to favour the accretion of non-growing dust grains onto the
               central object, but it slows down the migration of growing dust
               grains. If the disc has evolved into a self-shadowed structure,
               the required dust-to-gas ratio for dust grains to stop their
               migration at large radius become much smaller, of the order of
               0.01. All the disc configurations are found to have favourable
               temperature profiles over most of the disc to retain their

              is postulated to have been the main energy source promoting
              asteroidal melting and differentiation in the nascent solar
              system. High-resolution chronological information provided by the
              26Al-26Mg decay system is, therefore, intrinsically linked to the
              thermal evolution of early-formed planetesimals. In this paper, we
              explore the timing and style of asteroidal differentiation by
              combining high-precision Mg isotope measurements of meteorites
              with thermal evolution models for planetesimals. In detail, we
              report Mg isotope data for a suite of olivine-rich [Al/Mg ~ 0]
              achondritic meteorites, as well as a few chondrites. Main Group,
              pyroxene and the Zinder pallasites as well as the lodranite all
              record deficits in the mass-independent component of μ26Mg
              (μ26Mg*) relative to chondrites and Earth. This isotope signal is
              expected for the retarded ingrowth of radiogenic 26Mg* in
              olivine-rich residues produced through partial silicate melting
              during 26Al decay and consistent with their marginally heavy Mg
              isotope composition relative to ordinary chondrites, which may
              reflect the early extraction of isotopically light partial melts
              from the source rock. We propose that their parent planetesimals
              started forming within ~250,000 years of solar system formation
              from a hot (>~500 K) inner protoplanetary disk region
              characterized by a reduced initial (26Al/27Al)0 abundance (~1-2 ×
              10-5) relative to the (26Al/27Al)0 value in CAIs of 5.25 × 10-5.
              This effectively reduced the total heat production and allowed for
              the preservation of solid residues produced through progressive
              silicate melting with depth within the planetesimals. These
              'non-carbonaceous' planetesimals acquired their mass throughout an
              extended period (>3 Myr) of continuous accretion, thereby
              generating onion-shell structures of incompletely differentiated
              zones, consisting of olivine-rich residues, overlaid by
              metachondrites and undifferentiated chondritic crusts. In
              contrast, individual olivine crystals from Eagle Station
              pallasites record variable μ26Mg* excesses, suggesting that these
              crystals captured the 26Mg* evolution of a magmatic reservoir
              controlled by fractional crystallization processes during the
              lifespan of 26Al. Similar to previous suggestions based on
              isotopic evidence, we suggest that Eagle Station pallasites formed
              from precursor material similar in composition to carbonaceous
              chondrites from a cool outer protoplanetary disk region
              characterized by (26Al/27Al)0 ≥ 2.7 × 10-5. Protracted
              planetesimal accretion timescales at large orbital distances, with
              onset of accretion 0.3-1 Myr post-CAIs, may have resulted in
              significant radiative heat loss and thus efficient early interior
              cooling of slowly accreting 'carbonaceous' planetesimals.",

              All magmatic iron meteorites examined here have initial εW values
              that are similar to or slightly lower than the initial value of
              CAIs. These low εW values may in part reflect 182W-burnout caused

              effect is estimated to be less than ∼0.3 ε units for an exposure
              age of 600 Ma. The W isotope data, after correction for cosmic ray
              induced effects, indicate that core formation in the parent
              asteroids of the magmatic iron meteorites occurred less than ∼1.5
              Myr after formation of CAIs. The nonmagmatic IAB-IIICD irons and
              the metal-rich CB chondrites have more radiogenic W isotope
              compositions, indicating formation several Myr after the oldest
              metal cores had segregated in some asteroids. Chondrule formation
              ∼2–5 Myr after CAIs, as constrained by published Pb-Pb and Al-Mg
              ages, postdates core formation in planetesimals, and indicates
              that chondrites do not represent the precursor material from which
              asteroids accreted and then differentiated. Chondrites instead
              derive from asteroids that accreted late, either farther from the
              Sun than the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites or by
              reaccretion of debris produced during collisional disruption of
              older asteroids. Alternatively, chondrites may represent material
              from the outermost layers of differentiated asteroids. The early
              thermal and chemical evolution of asteroids appears to be
              controlled by the decay of 26Al, which was sufficiently abundant
              (initial 26Al/27Al >1.4 × 10−5) to rapidly melt early-formed
              planetesimals but could not raise the temperatures in the
              late-formed chondrite parent asteroids high enough to cause
              differentiation. The preservation of the primitive appearance of
              chondrites thus at least partially reflects their late formation

              would oppose thermal convection. We use elements of the theory of
              double-diffusive convection to create a parameterized model for
              the thermal evolution of ice/rock mixtures with a stabilizing
              compositional gradient. To account for large uncertainties in
              material properties and accretionary processes, we perform
              simulations for a wide range of initial conditions. Ultimately,
              for realistic density gradients, double-diffusive convection in
              the ice/rock interior can delay, but not prevent, ice melting and
              differentiation, even if a substantial fraction of potassium is
              leached from the rock component. Consequently, Titan is not
              partially differentiated.",

              silicate–metal segregation in planetesimals. Magmatic iron
              meteorites all have ε182W within error or less radiogenic than
              initial ε182W estimated by studies of chondritic meteorites. At
              face value this implies that iron meteorites are as old and older
              than refractory calcium–aluminium rich inclusions (CAI), which are
              widely thought to be the oldest solar system objects. Moreover,
              different meteorites from the same magmatic groups, believed to be
              derived from the same planetissimal core, display a range of
              ε182W. We suggest that the paradoxical ε182W values more negative
              than initial Solar System Initial (SSI) are most readily explained
              as a result of secondary, spallation reactions with cosmic rays
              during transit between parent body and the earth. This is
              supported by the most negative ε182W being found in meteorites
              with the oldest exposure ages and the magnitude of the effect is
              shown to be consistent with known nuclear reactions. On the other
              hand, it is also striking that none of the magmatic iron group
              meteorites have ε182W analyses, outside error, more radiogenic
              than the estimated solar system initial ratio. This suggests that
              core formation in parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites
              occurred ≤1.5 Myr after the formation age of CAI [Y. Amelin, A.N.
              Krot, I.D. Hutcheon, and A.A. Ulyanov, Lead isotopic ages of
              chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions, Science 297,
              1678–1683, 2002]. This extremely early metal–silicate
              differentiation is coeval with the first chondrules [M. Bizzarro,
              J.A. Baker, and H. Haack, Mg isotope evidence for contemporaneous
              formation of chondrules and refractory inclusions, Nature 431,

              Solar System, Nature 436, 989–992, 2005]. Formation of later
              chondrules, and hence the parent bodies of some chondritic
              meteorites, must therefore have occurred in the presence of
              planetesimals large enough to possess iron cores. We conclude that
              early planetary accretion and differentiation was sufficiently
              fast for 26Al-decay to be an important heat source. Non-magmatic
              iron meteorites, however, display more radiogenic and varied W
              isotope signatures. This is in keeping with them being generated
              later, by impact melting during which the metal (partially)
              re-equilibrated with the then more radiogenic silicate fraction.",

  pages    = "256--273",
  abstract = "In the core-accretion model, giant-planet cores form by oligarchic
              growth from a population of planetesimals prior to the dispersal
              of the disk gas. Once a core reaches a critical mass of roughly 10
              Earth masses, it begins to accrete a gaseous envelope, forming a
              giant planet. Collisions between planetesimals cause
              fragmentation. Planetesimal fragments are more easily captured by
              cores, speeding up growth, but fragments are also lost by radial
              drift, reducing the total solid mass in the disk. Interaction with
              the gas causes cores to undergo inward type-I migration. Migration
              allows a core to accrete planetesimals from a larger region, but
              migrating cores may be lost if they reach the star. Thus,
              migration and fragmentation have both a positive and a negative
              impact on core formation. Here we describe results of new
              simulations of oligarchic growth that include fragmentation and/or
              migration. In the absence of migration, cores grow until they
              reach their isolation mass, which increases with distance from the
              star, or until the disk gas disperses. Fragmentation increases the
              maximum core mass by increasing growth rates in the outer disk,
              allowing objects to reach their isolation mass during the disk
              lifetime. When migration is present, cores migrate inwards rapidly
              when they approach 1 Earth mass. Most migrating cores are lost.
              Migrating cores gain little extra mass since they are passing
              through regions that have been depleted by earlier generations of
              cores. For a disk viscosity parameter alpha=1e−3 and planetesimal
              radius=10 km, the maximum core mass is roughly 4 and 0.5 Earth
              masses with/without fragmentation, respectively, with little
              dependence on the disk mass. Formation and survival of
              10-Earth-mass cores, in the presence of migration, requires large
              alpha (1e−2) and a massive disk (0.1 solar masses). When alpha is
              large, type-I migration rates decrease rapidly with time, allowing
              large, late-forming cores to survive. The addition of a stochastic
              (random-walk) migration component makes little difference to the
              outcome, provided that stochastic migration affects only cores
              larger than 0.01 Earth masses. Stochastic migration becomes
              increasingly important if it also affects lower-mass objects.",

               using shock effects in rock-forming minerals such as olivine and
               plagioclase. The S6 stage (55–90 GPa; 850–1750 °C) relies solely
               on localized effects in or near melt zones, the recrystallization
               of olivine, or the presence of mafic high-pressure phases such as
               ringwoodite. However, high whole rock temperatures and the
               presence of high-pressure phases that are unstable at those
               temperatures and pressures of zero GPa (e.g., ringwoodite) are
               two criteria that exclude each other. Each type of high-pressure
               phase provides a minimum shock pressure during elevated pressure
               conditions to allow the formation of this phase, and a maximum
               temperature of the whole rock after decompression to allow the
               preservation of this phase. Rocks classified as S6 are
               characterized not by the presence but by the absence of those
               thermally unstable high-pressure phases. High-pressure phases in
               or attached to shock melt zones form mainly during shock pressure
               decline. This is because shocked rocks (<60 GPa) experience a
               shock wave with a broad isobaric pressure plateau only during low
               velocity (<4.5 km s−1) impacts, which rarely occur on small
               planetary bodies; e.g., the Moon and asteroids. The mineralogy of
               shock melt zones provides information on the shape and temporal
               duration of the shock wave but no information on the general
               maximum shock pressure in the whole rock.",

               Consideration of the behavior of S during condensation and core
               formation indicates that these cores, at least in the case of
               groups having high or moderate volatile contents (IIAB, IIIAB),
               contained a substantial amount of S. When elemental
               fractionations observed in these iron meteorite groups are
               compared to model calculations of fractional crystallization it
               becomes evident that at least the IIAB parent melt, and very
               likely the IIIAB parent melt as well, did not contain the full S
               complement of the parent body. We consider three possible
               scenarios to account for the S depletion: (1) Outgassing of S
               during parent body differentiation; this was probably only
               possible if the parent body contained organic material, which is
               improbable for IIIAB. (2) Liquid immiscibility. Our fractional
               crystallization model would predict curved log Xvs. log Ni
               relationships in this case, which for many elements are not
               observed. (3) Formation of metastable liquid layers by episodic
               melting during core formation. This is based on the fact that the
               difference in melting temperature between a FeFeS eutectic and
               FeNi metals is ∼500 K. Two melting episodes would tend to form
               distinct liquid layers that maintain their identities over the
               crystallization lifetime of the core.Solidification of the cores
               parental to the main iron meteorite groups should also produce a
               significant number of sulfide meteorites. The scarcity of
               sulfide-rich meteorites can be attributed to their lower
               mechanical resistance to space attrition, higher ablation during
               atmospheric passage, and faster weathering on earth.",

              filled with glass these features, called embayments or reentrants,
              have been used to petrologically constrain magmatic ascent rate.
              Embayment ascent speedometry relies on the record of
              disequilibrium preserved as diffusion-limited volatile
              concentration gradients in the embayment glass. Clear, glassy
              embayments are carefully selected for speedometry studies. The use
              and subsequent descriptions of pristine embayments overrepresent
              their actual abundance. Here, we provide a textural analysis of
              the number, morphology, and filling characteristics of
              quartz-hosted embayments. We target a collection of large (i.e.,
              >20 km3 erupted volume) silicic eruptions, including the Bishop
              Tuff, Tuff of Bluff Point, Bandelier Tuff, Mesa Falls Tuff, and
              Huckleberry Ridge Tuff in the United States, Oruanui Tuff in New
              Zealand, Younger Toba Tuff in Indonesia, the Kos Plateau Tuff in
              Greece, and the Giant Pumice from La Primavera caldera in Mexico.
              For each unit, hundreds of quartz crystals were picked and the
              total number of embayment-hosting crystals were counted and
              categorized into classifications based on the vesicularity and
              morphology. We observed significant variability in embayment
              abundance, form, and vesicularity across different eruptions.
              Simple, cylindrical forms are the most common, as are dense glassy
              embayments. Increasingly complex shapes and a range of bubble
              textures are also common. Embayments may crosscut or deflect
              prominent internal cathodoluminescence banding in the host quartz,
              indicating that embayments form by both dissolution and growth. We
              propose potential additional timescales recorded by embayment
              disequilibrium textures, namely, faceting, bubbles, and the lack
              thereof. Embayment formation likely occurs tens to hundreds of
              years before eruption because embayment surfaces are rounded
              instead of faceted. Bubble textures in embayments are far from
              those predicted by equilibrium solubility. Homogenous nucleation
              conditions likely allow preservation of pressures much greater
              than magmastatic inside embayments. Our textural observations lend
              insight into embayment occurrence and formation and guide further

               gas generation and subsequent migration and venting may have
               contributed to several of the past climatic changes such as the
               end-Permian event and the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum.
               Additionally, the generation and expulsion of hydrocarbons and
               cracking of pre-existing oil reservoirs around a hot magmatic
               intrusion are of significant interest to the energy industry. In
               this paper, we present a user-friendly 1-D finite element method
               (FEM)-based tool, SILLi, which calculates the thermal effects of
               sill intrusions on the enclosing sedimentary stratigraphy. The
               model is accompanied by three case studies of sills emplaced in
               two different sedimentary basins, the Karoo Basin in South Africa
               and the Vøring Basin off the shore of Norway. An additional
               example includes emplacement of a dyke in a cooling pluton which
               forgoes sedimentation within a basin. Input data for the model
               are the present-day well log or sedimentary column with an Excel
               input file and include rock parameters such as thermal
               conductivity, total organic carbon (TOC) content, porosity and
               latent heats. The model accounts for sedimentation and burial
               based on a rate calculated by the sedimentary layer thickness and
               age. Erosion of the sedimentary column is also included to
               account for realistic basin evolution. Multiple sills can be
               emplaced within the system with varying ages. The emplacement of
               a sill occurs instantaneously. The model can be applied to
               volcanic sedimentary basins occurring globally. The model output
               includes the thermal evolution of the sedimentary column through
               time and the changes that take place following sill emplacement
               such as TOC changes, thermal maturity and the amount of organic
               and carbonate-derived CO2. The TOC and vitrinite results can be
               readily benchmarked within the tool to present-day values
               measured within the sedimentary column. This allows the user to
               determine the conditions required to obtain results that match
               observables and leads to a better understanding of metamorphic
               processes in sedimentary basins.",

  abstract = "A consensus has emerged in recent years from a variety of
              geoscientific disciplines that extension during continental
              rifting is achieved only partly by plate stretching: dyke
              intrusion also plays an important role. Magma intrusion can
              accommodate extension at lower yield stresses than are required to
              extend thick, strong, unmodified continental lithosphere
              mechanically, thereby aiding the breakup process. Dyke intrusion
              is also expected to heat and thereby weaken the plate, but the
              spatial extent of heating and the effect of different rates of
              magmatic extension on the timescales over which heating occurs are
              poorly understood. To address this issue, a numerical solution to
              the heat-flow equation is developed here to quantify the thermal
              effects of dyke intrusion on the continental crust during rifting.
              The thermal models are benchmarked against a priori constraints on
              crustal structure and dyke intrusion episodes in Ethiopia. Finite
              difference models demonstrate that magmatic extension rate exerts
              a first-order control on the crustal thermal structure. Once dyke
              intrusion supersedes faulting and stretching as the principal
              extensional mechanism the crust will heat and weaken rapidly (less
              than 1 Ma). In the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), the majority of
              present-day extension is focused on ∼20 km-wide Quaternary-Recent
              axial magmatic segments that are mostly seismogenic to mid-crustal
              depths and show P-wave seismic velocities characteristic of
              heavily intruded continental crust. When reviewed in light of our
              models, these observations require that no more than half of the
              MER's extension since ∼2 Ma has been achieved by dyke intrusion.
              Magmatic heating and weakening of the crust would have rendered it
              aseismic if dyke intrusion accounted for the entire 6 mm/yr
              extension rate. In the older, faster extending (16 mm/yr) Red Sea
              rift (RSR) in Afar, dyke intrusion is expected to have had a more
              dramatic impact on crustal rheology. Accordingly, effective
              elastic plate thickness and Moho depth in the Danakil region of
              northernmost Afar are markedly reduced and seismicity is shallower
              than in the MER. Thermally driven variations in crustal rheology
              over time in response to dyke intrusion thus play an important
              role in the development of continent–ocean transition.",

              interpret these observations, we must know the degree of mixing
              and equilibration between metal and silicates following the
              collisions that formed the Earth. Recent fluid dynamical
              experiments provide initial estimates of this mixing, but they
              entirely neglect the inertia of planet-building impactors. Here we
              use laboratory experiments on the impact of a dense liquid volume
              into a lighter liquid pool to establish scaling laws for mixing as
              a function of the impactor speed, size, density and the local
              gravity. Our experiments reproduce the cratering process observed
              in impact simulations. They also produce turbulence down to small
              scales, approaching the dynamical regime of planetary impacts. In
              each experiment, we observe an early impact-dominated stage, which
              includes the formation of a crater, its collapse into an upward
              jet, and the collapse of the jet. At later times, we observe the
              downward propagation of a buoyant thermal. We quantify the
              contribution to mixing from both the impact and subsequent thermal
              stage. Our experimental results, together with our theoretical
              calculations, indicate that the collapse of the jet produces much
              of the impact-induced mixing. We find that the ratio between the
              jet inertia and the impactor buoyancy controls mixing. Applied to
              Earth's formation, we predict full chemical equilibration for
              impactors less than 100 km in diameter, but only partial
              equilibration for Moon-forming giant impacts. With our new
              scalings that account for the impactor inertia, the mass transfer
              between metal and silicates is up to twenty times larger than
              previous estimates. This reduces the accretion timescale, deduced
              from isotopic data, by up to a factor of ten and the equilibration

               potential insulating effects of regolith and megaregolith
               (brecciated impact rubble) layers. The regolith is assumed to
               have thermal conductivity 0.005?the unbrecciated mantle
               conductivity, and its thickness, in our most typical model, is
               assumed to be 0.003?the parent body radius. The megaregolith, if
               present, is assumed to have thermal conductivity 0.1?that of
               unbrecciated mantle. We find that a combination of relatively
               thick megaregolith and regolith can potentially reduce the core
               cooling rate by more than a factor of 10 below the rate predicted
               by models with conventional thermal conductivity structure. For
               any given measured cooling rate, the radius implied for the
               parent asteroid can potentially be reduced by a factor of 5 from
               the radius predicted by models with conventional thermal
               conductivity structure. Realistically, the regolith and
               megaregolith thicknesses required to engender these extreme
               effects were probably seldom generated, except perhaps within the
               largest asteroids (where, even if generated, they would quickly
               be reduced by compaction and sintering). Nonetheless, our results
               for models with plausible regolith and megaregolith thicknesses
               indicate that most of the iron meteorites and the pallasites
               probably formed in relatively small (R less than 50 km) parent
               bodies. We have parameterized our results so that effects of
               intermediate configurations can readily be calculated. The
               parameterization also facilitates evaluation of additional
               variables, e.g., the initial temperature, the concentrations of
               long-lived radioactive heat sources, etc., albeit these variables
               are far less crucial than the thermal conductivity structure. Our
               results indicate that the insulation of even a thin regolith
               causes metallalographic cooling rates to be relatively uniform,
               and practically independent of depth, within a given asteroid.
               Stochastic differences in cratering (regolith production)
               histories may have engendered radically different cooling rates
               from asteroids of similar radius, or similar cooling rates from
               asteroids of different radius.",

               exceeds the least principal lithostatic stress by a critical
               amount. After decrepitation, excess fluid pressure is relaxed,
               resulting in crack arrest; subsequently, crack healing may occur.
               Existing models of decrepitation do not adequately explain
               several experimentally observed phenomena. We developed a linear
               elastic fracture mechanics model to analyze new data on
               decrepitation and crack arrest in San Carlos olivine, compared
               the model with previous fluid inclusion investigations, and used
               it to interpret some natural decrepitation microstructures. The
               common experimental observation that smaller inclusions may
               sustain higher internal fluid pressures without decrepitating may
               be rationalized by assuming that flaws associated with the
               inclusion scale with the inclusion size. According to the model,
               the length of the crack formed by decrepitation depends on the
               lithostatic pressure at the initiation of cracking, the initial
               sizes of the flaw and the inclusion, and the critical stress
               intensity factor. Further experiments show that microcracks in
               San Carlos olivine heal within several days at 1280 to 1400°C;
               healing rates depend on the crack geometry, temperature, and
               chemistry of the buffering gas. The regression distance of the
               crack tip during healing can be related to time through a power
               law with exponent n = 0.6. Chemical changes which become apparent
               after extremely long heat-treatments significantly affect the
               healing rates. Many of the inclusions in the San Carlos xenoliths
               stretched, decrepitated, and finally healed during uplift. The
               crack arrest model indicates that completely healed cracks had an
               initial fluid pressure of the order of 1 GPa. Using the crack
               arrest model and the healing kinetics, we estimate the ascent
               rate of these xenoliths to be between 0.001 and 0.1 m/s.

               spherical pores when subjected to heat treatments at
               1250°C?1400°C; laboratory produced cracks also heal rapidly at
               1000°C. In addition to being thermally activated, the kinetics of
               the healing process depend on the crack dimensions and apparently
               either the chemical speciation or the pressure of the fluid
               filling the crack. Interpretation of the results of these
               experiments using theories of diffusive crack healing developed
               for metals and ceramics indicates that surface diffusion is
               probably the dominant mechanism of crack healing. The effective
               activation energy of the break-up of the cylindrical voids is
               approximately 53 ± 22 kcal/mole and the time necessary to produce
               a spherical void from a cylinder is proportional to the fourth
               power of the radius of the cylinder. The region of healed crystal
               between the spherical pores contains dislocations which are
               apparently formed during the healing process as accommodation of

               formed in the absence of deformation, inherit the general
               crystallographic orientation from their parents, but also display
               a development of new microstructures that are typical in deformed

  abstract = "Abstract Meteorites and lunar surface rocks experienced at least
              one, and possibly more, exposures to cosmic-ray particles. The
              nuclear effects within the extraterrestrial materials allow us to
              determine how long a meteorite existed as a meter-sized object
              before capture by Earth and how long a lunar rock resided on the
              top of the lunar surface until collection. In this review I
              discuss the cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages of the different
              meteorite classes that originated from the asteroid belt, Mars,
              and Moon. From mineralogical and isotopic characteristics it
              appears that there are impact produced fragments from about 100
              asteroids in our collections. A large fraction of the meteorites
              from a specific class originated from a small number of ejection
              events. The stone meteorites representing crust and mantle
              materials of planetary bodies traveled for ≤ 120 Ma in space. The
              CRE ages of iron meteorites, the fragments of the cores of
              differentiated asteroids, are up to 1500 Ma, probably due to
              stronger resistance against crushing in space compared to silicate
              material. Rocks blasted off the Moon and Mars by asteroidal or
              cometary impacts are particularly valuable as they represent
              surface areas that were not previously sampled by manned or
              automated missions. The CRE ages of lunar and martian meteorites
              indicate that up to eight sites on the Moon and the same number of
              sites on Mars were sampled by the presently studied meteorites.
              They represent a dramatic increase of the sampling of the lunar
              and martian crust. The CRE ages of rocks collected by the Apollo
              missions on the rims of lunar craters were used to date the impact
              events exposing these rocks to the cosmic particle irradiation.
              When martian material will be available for laboratory studies,
              this dating method can also be applied to craters and young lava

               Within two polished sections of Winchcombe, terrestrial phases
               were observed. Calcite and calcium sulfates were found in a
               sample recovered from a field on March 6, 2021, and halite was
               observed on a sample months after its recovery from a driveway on
               March 2, 2021. These terrestrial phases were characterized by
               scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and
               transmission electron microscopy. Calcite veins crosscut the
               fusion crust and therefore postdate it. The calcite likely
               precipitated in the damp environment (sheep field) where the
               meteorite lay for six?days prior to its retrieval. The sulfates
               occur on the edges of the sample and were identified as three
               minerals: gypsum, bassanite, and anhydrite. Given that the
               sulfates occur only on the sample's edges, including on top of
               the fusion crust, they formed after Winchcombe fell. Sulfate
               precipitation is attributed to the damp fall environment, likely
               resulted from sulfide-derived H2S reacting with calcite within

               surface of a polished section and exclusively in areas relatively

               the polished rock slice with the humid laboratory air over a
               period of months. The sulfates, fusion crust calcite, and halite

               events (SSEs) are typically interpreted as aseismic frictional
               sliding. However, SSEs may also occur via mixed viscobrittle
               deformation, as observed in shear zones containing mixtures
               (mélange) of strong fractured clasts embedded in a weak
               viscobrittle matrix. We test the hypothesis that creep in a
               subduction mélange occurs through distributed matrix deformation,
               where flow is intermittently impeded by load-bearing clast
               networks (jamming). Our numerical models demonstrate that bulk
               mélange rheology can be dominated by the strong clasts in the
               absence of fracturing, while at high driving stresses or low
               frictional strength, clast fracturing redistributes deformation
               into the matrix, leading to high bulk strain rates. Because
               mélange stress is heterogeneous, fracturing of clasts occurs
               throughout jammed mélange when the driving stresses are only
               ?20\% of the clast yield strength. The effective rheology of
               jammed mélange can be characterized by a logarithmic dependence
               of stress on strain rate, which is used to explore strain rate
               transients caused by temporal variation in clast friction. Clasts
               must weaken significantly (?75\%) in order to increase strain
               rate by 8 times. Spring-block slider models with a more idealized
               viscobrittle rheology also demonstrate that strain rate
               transients can be generated when rate-and-state friction is
               incorporated. We outline a model where high bulk strain rates are
               generated when pervasive fracturing occurs, but further slip is
               limited by viscous processes. Incorporating such viscous damping
               into models may widen the conditions under which SSEs can occur
               while preventing development of seismic slip.",

              metallic cores of asteroid-sized parent bodies. Sulfur is believed
              to have been an important constituent of these parental cores, but
              due to the low solubility of S in solid metal, initial S-contents
              for the magmatic groups cannot be determined through direct
              measurements of the iron meteorites. However, experimental solid
              metal-liquid metal partition coefficients show a strong dependence
              on the S-content of the metallic liquid. Thus, by using the
              experimental partition coefficients to model the fractional
              crystallization trends within magmatic iron meteorite groups, the
              S-contents of the parental cores can be indirectly estimated.
              Modeling the Au, Ga, Ge, and Ir fractionations in four of the
              largest magmatic iron meteorite groups leads to best estimates for
              the S-contents of the parental cores of 12 ± 1.5 wt\% for the

              trapped melt. The discrepancy is due largely to the different

              partition coefficients that are consistent with the experimental
              data are used, the trapped melt model, and the low S-contents it

               differentiated (and potentially, partially differentiated)
               planetesimals generated dynamo fields in the first 5?40 Myr after
               the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs). This
               early period of dynamo activity has been attributed to thermal
               convection in the liquid cores of these planetesimals during an
               early period of magma ocean convection. To better understand the
               controls on thermal dynamo generation in planetesimals, we have
               developed a one dimensional model of the thermal evolution of
               planetesimals from accretion through to the shutdown of
               convection in their silicate magma oceans for a variety of
               accretionary scenarios. The heat source of these bodies is the
               short-lived radiogenic isotope 26Al. During differentiation, 26Al
               partitions into the silicate portion of these bodies, causing
               their magma oceans to heat up and introducing stable thermal
               stratification to the top of their cores, which inhibits dynamo
               generation. In ?instantaneously? accreting bodies, this effect
               causes a delay on the order of >10 Myr to whole core convection
               and dynamo generation while this stratification is eroded.
               However, gradual core formation in bodies that accrete over >0.1
               Myr can minimize the development of this stratification, allowing
               dynamo generation from ?4 Myr after CAI formation. Our model also
               predicts partially differentiated planetesimals with a core and
               mantle overlain by a chondritic crust for accretion timescales
               >1.2 Myr, although none of these bodies generate a thermal dynamo
               field. We compare our results from thousands of model runs to the

               informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data
               science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice,
               improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also
               been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential
               for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it
               essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom?
               Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around
               big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and
               techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren
               Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data
               ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.
               Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show
               how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other
               hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They
               explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand
               our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept
               of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts
               required by our automated systems. And they show why the data
               never, ever “speak for themselves.” Data Feminism offers
               strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can
               help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to
               focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But
               Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power,
               about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those
               differentials of power can be challenged and changed.",

               mobile tutor we developed for Python programming, aimed to serve
               as a supplement to traditional courses. The overarching goal of
               our work is to design coding activities that maximize learning.
               As we work towards our goal, we first focus on the learning
               effectiveness of the activities within PyKinetic, rather than
               evaluating the effectiveness of PyKinetic as a supplement
               resource for an introductory programming course. The version of
               PyKinetic (PyKinetic\_DbgOut) used in the study contains five
               types of learning activities aimed at supporting debugging,
               code-tracing, and code writing skills. We evaluated PyKinetic in
               a controlled lab study with quantitative and qualitative results
               to address the following research questions: (R1) Is the
               combination of coding activities effective for learning
               programming? (R2) How do the activities affect the skills of
               students with lower prior knowledge (novices) compared to those
               who had higher prior knowledge (advanced)? (R3) How can we
               improve the usability of PyKinetic? Results revealed that
               PyKinetic\_DbgOut was more beneficial for advanced students.
               Furthermore, we found how coding skills are interrelated
               differently for novices compared to advanced learners. Lastly, we

               this data set, we confirm that the compressive strength of
               ordinary chondrites (varying in the range of 10s to 100s of MPa)

               results on single crystals. The stress dependencies of the
               mobilities of [100] and [001] dislocations are emphasized.
               Dislocations interactions are studied through a simple elastic
               analysis and further using a more realistic approach based on DD
               simulations. It is shown that no junction formation results from
               the interaction between [100] and [001] dislocations. The

              growth, potentially yield important implications for the final
              composition and evolution of terrestrial planets. These parameters
              critically depend on the internal balance of heating versus
              cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived
              radionuclides (SLRs), such as 26Al and 60Fe, as well as the heat
              conductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their
              initial abundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its
              size. It has been argued that the cooling history is determined by
              the porosity of the granular material, which undergoes dramatic
              changes via compaction processes and tends to decrease with time.
              In this study we assess the influence of these parameters on the
              thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both 2D
              and 3D simulations. Using the code family i2elvis/i3elvis we have
              run numerous 2D and 3D numerical finite-difference fluid dynamic
              models with varying planetesimal radius, formation time and
              initial porosity. Our results indicate that powdery materials
              lowered the threshold for melting and convection in planetesimals,
              depending on the amount of SLRs present. A subset of planetesimals
              retained a powdery surface layer which lowered the thermal
              conductivity and hindered cooling. The effect of initial porosity
              was small, however, compared to those of planetesimal size and
              formation time, which dominated the thermo-mechanical evolution
              and were the primary factors for the onset of melting and
              differentiation. We comment on the implications of this work
              concerning the structure and evolution of these planetesimals, as
              well as their behavior as possible building blocks of terrestrial

              heat source in the early Solar System, by calculations that show
              them to be an inefficient heat source and unlikely to cause global
              heating. However, the long-term, localized thermal effects of
              impacts on planetesimals have never been fully quantified. Here,
              we simulate a range of impact scenarios between planetesimals to
              determine the post-impact thermal histories of the parent bodies,
              and hence the importance of impact heating in the thermal
              evolution of planetesimals. We find on a local scale that heating
              material to petrologic type 6 is achievable for a range of impact
              velocities and initial porosities, and impact melting is possible
              in porous material at a velocity of >4km/s. Burial of heated
              impactor material beneath the impact crater is common, insulating
              that material and allowing the parent body to retain the heat for
              extended periods (∼millions of years). Cooling rates at 773K are
              typically 1–1000K/Ma, matching a wide range of measurements of

               an omni-directional source of scattered electrons within a
               specimen. Diffraction of these electrons will occur
               simultaneously on all lattice planes in the sample and the
               backscattered electrons (BSE), which escape from the specimen,
               will form a diffraction pattern that can be imaged on a phosphor
               screen. This is the basis of electron backscatter diffraction
               (EBSD). Similar diffraction effects cause individual grains of
               different orientations to give different total BSE. SEM images
               that exploit this effect will show orientation contrast (OC).
               EBSD and OC imaging are SEM-based crystallographic tools. EBSD
               enables measurement of the crystallographic orientation of
               individual rock-forming minerals as small as 1 mu m, and the
               calculation of misorientation axes and angles between any two
               data points. OC images enable mapping of all misorientation
               boundaries in a specimen and thus provide a location map for EBSD
               analyses. EBSD coupled to OC imaging in the SEM enables complete
               specimen microtextures and mesotextures to be determined. EBSD
               and OC imaging can be applied to any mineral at a range of scales
               and enable us to expand the microstructural approach, so
               successful in studies of quartz rocks, for example, to the full
               range of rock-forming minerals. Automated EBSD analysis of rocks
               remains problematic, although continuing technical developments
               are enabling progress in this area. EBSD and OC are important new
               tools for petrologists and petrographers. Present and future
               applications of EBSD and OC imaging include phase identification,
               studying deformation mechanisms, constraining dislocation slip
               systems, empirical quantification of microstructures, studying
               metamorphic processes, studying magmatic processes, and

               40Ar at low temperature, and gives a plateau age of 4.59 ± 0.03
               Ga. Although the Xe data fail to define an I-Xe correlation
               (possibly due to a very low iodine content), the inferred PuU
               ratio is more than 2σ above the chondritic value, and the Pu
               abundance derived from the concentration of Pu-fission Xe is 6
               times greater than the abundance inferred for Cl meteorites.
               These findings for Enon, coupled with data for IAB iron
               meteorites, suggest that presence of chondritic silicate in an
               iron-rich meteorite is diagnostic of an old radiometric age with
               little subsequent thermal disturbance. The Eagle Station
               pallasite, the most 16O-rich meteorite known, gives a complex
               40Ar-39Ar age pattern which suggests a recent (≲0.85 Ga) severe

               Station and for the olivine-rich meteorite Chassigny lends
               credence to the previous suggestion of a connection between

              It requires identifying grains tending to accumulate plastic
              deformation under cyclic loading. We address this task by
              transcribing ferritic steel microtexture and damage maps from
              experiments into a microstructure graph. Here, grains constitute
              graph nodes connected by edges whenever grains share a common
              boundary. Fatigue loading causes some grains to develop slip
              markings, which can evolve into microcracks and lead to failure.
              This data set enables applying graph neural network variants on
              the task of binary grain-wise damage classification. The objective
              is to identify suitable data representations and models with an

               are major minerals in the mantle transition zone (MTZ). Phase

               earthquakes in subduction zones. In this study, we examine phase
               transformations in olivine with two compositions, namely Mg2SiO4
               (Fo100) and (Mg0.9Fe0.1)2SiO4 (Fo90), at pressures between 14.1
               and 20 GPa and a constant temperature of 1400°C, using the newly
               installed multi-anvil system at the Laboratory for Studies of the
               Earth’s Deep Interior (SEDI), China University of Geosciences
               (Wuhan). At 14.1 GPa, Fo90 transformed completely into the
               wadsleyite structure (β), while Fo100 remained as olivine (α).
               Between 14.8 and 15.6 GPa, both Fo100 and Fo90 transformed into
               the wadsleyite structure. Wadsleyite crystals were identified by
               two characteristic Raman peaks between 722 and 723 and 917 and
               919 cm−1. They exhibit a bimodal grain size distribution:
               large-crystals with average grain sizes greater than 100 μm and
               microcrystals less than 10 μm. The population of microcrystals
               increased with pressure, apparently due to the increase in
               over-pressure (the difference between the experimental pressure
               condition and the equilibrium transformation pressure at 1400°C),
               which promotes nucleation and retards grain growth. All run
               charges contained large numbers of wadsleyite microcrystals,
               because of the low activation energy of the nucleation process.
               The experimentally observed microstructure may shed light on the
               morphology of wadsleyite observed in shocked meteorites. At 19.5
               GPa, wadsleyite coexisted with ringwoodite (γ) in Fo100, but was
               absent in Fo90. At 20 GPa, both samples transformed completely
               into ringwoodite, which was characterized by the 798 and 840 cm−1
               Raman lines. Ringwoodite crystals are euhedral grains (average
               grain size 10–20 μm), with well-developed triple junctions. The
               complex upper mantle structure in eastern China determined from
               seismological studies cannot be explained by the simple
               transformation sequence of the olivine system alone. Phase
               transformations in other pyroxene-normative components (including
               pyroxenes and garnets) and the interaction of these components
               with olivine may be responsible for the complex structure.
               High-pressure and high-temperature experimental studies on
               complex systems (e.g. olivine-pyroxene), combined with data from
               geophysical exploration, may help in establishing a more
               realistic geological-petrological model for eastern China and
               further our understanding of the possible physical mechanisms
               that are responsible for the complex structure. Such studies will
               have profound implications for understanding the dynamic
               processes in the deep Earth interior.",

               polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) and among these major
               phases in the upper mantle and the mantle transition zone based
               on reported structure refinements and chemical compositions of
               both natural and synthetic mineral samples. We discuss the
               concepts of a potential reservoir of transition metals in the
               mantle transition zone and the possible alterations of globally
               observed 410-km and 520-km discontinuities due to metal element
               substitutions in olivine polymorphs. We also focus on the crystal
               chemistry of wadsleyite II (the fourth polymorph of olivine) and
               the effects of this potential constituent mantle phase on the
               properties of the middle part of the transition zone. A summary
               of recent studies indicates that, (1) for olivine and wadsleyite,
               site preference of a transition metal cation in the crystal
               structure is controlled by multiple factors that include cation
               size, site geometry, crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE),
               and oxygen bond-type. These factors may also determine the
               distributions of transition metal elements among olivine
               polymorphs; (2) Ni, Cr, and Ti prefer wadsleyite and ringwoodite
               to olivine, indicating that the mantle transition zone may be a
               potential reservoir of these transition metal elements,
               particularly if a small amount of melt is present near phase
               boundaries; (3) Ni2+, Co2+, and Fe2+ in the crystal structures
               have significant influences on the thermodynamic properties and
               phase transitions of olivine polymorphs. The incorporation of
               minor Ni2+ or Co2+ (>5 at.\%) into the octahedral sites in
               wadsleyite could possibly lead to a shift of the 520-km
               discontinuity of about 30–80 km to shallower depths. In contrast,
               the stability field of wadsleyite can be expanded to higher and
               lower pressures in the presence of Cr3+ and Ti4+. Therefore, the
               localized high concentrations of these transition metal cations
               in the mantle transition zone may also contribute to the

               transformation of olivine to wadsleyite was investigated using a
               multi-anvil high-pressure apparatus. We identified three stages
               in the microstructure evolution during olivine to wadsleyite
               phase transformation: (1) nucleation of wadsleyite along
               potential nucleation sites (e.g., grain boundaries (and grain
               corners), inside of grains (dislocations, stacking faults)), (2)
               development of an interconnected network of fine-grained
               wadsleyite along grain boundaries (3) growth of wadsleyite into
               olivine. Our observations suggest that at low over pressures (3
               GPa), intra-crystalline nucleation makes a significant
               contribution to the volume fraction transformed. The rheological
               properties of a sample undergoing the phase transformation are
               controlled by the grain-size and the connectivity of newly formed
               grains. Based on the model of grain-size evolution involving both
               nucleation and growth, we show that the initial grain-size of
               wadsleyite is controlled by the competition between nucleation
               rate and growth rate when phase transformation takes place near
               the equilibrium boundary (at relatively higher temperatures,
               >1200 K) but mostly by critical size for nucleation when phase
               transformation takes place away from the equilibrium boundary (at
               relatively low temperatures, <1200 K). After the newly formed
               grains cover the potential sites for nucleation
               (“site-saturation”), grain-size is governed by grain-growth till
               ∼50\% volume fraction is transformed. Due to the temperature
               sensitivity of initial size and of the grain-growth rate, the
               size of newly formed grains in subducting slabs is highly
               sensitive to the temperature at which the phase transformation
               occurs. At low temperatures, the size of new grains is small due
               to small initial grain-size and sluggish grain-growth. In
               contrast, grain-size during phase transformation is large at high
               temperatures due to the large initial grain-size and subsequent
               fast grain-growth kinetics. Consequently, substantial reduction
               of slab strength is expected in the cold regions of a subducting

              characterized by their slip systems, can provide a record of grain
              internal deformation. Comprehensive examination of this record has
              been limited by intrinsic limitations of the observational
              methods. Transmission electron microscopy reveals individual
              dislocations, but images only a few square $$\upmu$$m of sample.
              Oxidative decoration requires involved sample preparation and has
              uncertainties in detection of all dislocations and their types.
              The possibility of mapping dislocation density and slip systems by
              conventional (Hough-transform based) EBSD is investigated here
              with naturally and experimentally deformed San Carlos olivine
              single crystals. Geometry and dislocation structures of crystals
              deformed in orientations designed to activate particular slip
              systems were previously analyzed by TEM and oxidative decoration.
              A curvature tensor is calculated from changes in orientation of
              the crystal lattice, which is inverted to calculate density of
              geometrically necessary dislocations with the Matlab Toolbox MTEX.
              Densities of individual dislocation types along with
              misorientation axes are compared to orientation change measured on
              the deformed crystals. After filtering (denoising), noise floor
              and calculated dislocation densities are comparable to those
              reported from high resolution EBSD mapping. For samples deformed
              in [110]c and [011]c orientations EBSD mapping confirms [100](010)
              and [001](010), respectively, as the dominant slip systems. EBSD
              mapping thus enables relatively efficient observation of
              dislocation structures associated with intracrystalline
              deformation, both distributed, and localized at sub-boundaries,
              over substantially larger areas than has previously been possible.
              This will enable mapping of dislocation structures in both
              naturally and experimentally deformed polycrystals, with
              potentially new insights into deformation processes in Earth’s
              upper mantle.",

               abundant mineral in Earth's upper mantle and is stable down to
               the olivine–wadsleyite phase transition, which defines the 410 km
               depth mantle transition zone. Olivine also occurs in crustal
               environments in metamorphic and hydrothermal rocks and is
               expected to be the major mineral constituent of the Martian and
               Venusian mantles. The olivine atomic structure is also used in
               materials science to manufacture lithium batteries. Like any
               other crystalline solid, including minerals, olivine never occurs
               with a perfect crystalline structure: defects in various
               dimensions are ubiquitous, from point, line, and planar defects
               to three-dimensional (3-D) inclusions. In this contribution, I
               review the current state of the art of defects in olivine and
               several implications for key processes occurring in Earth's
               mantle. Intrinsic and extrinsic point defects are detailed,
               exemplifying the astonishing diversity of atomic impurities in
               mantle-derived olivine. Linear defects, one of the key defect
               types responsible for ductile deformation in crystalline solids,
               are examined in light of recent progress in 3-D transmission
               electron microscopy, which has revealed an important diversity of
               dislocation slip systems. I summarize the principal
               characteristics of interface defects in olivine: the free
               surface, grain and interface boundaries, and internal planar
               defects. As the least-studied defects to date, interface defects
               represent an important challenge for future studies and are the
               main application of numerical simulation methods in materials
               science. I provide an overview of melt, fluid, and mineral
               inclusions, which are widely studied in volcanology and igneous
               petrology. Special attention is given to new crystalline defects
               that act as deformation agents: disclinations (rotational
               defects) and the potential occurrence of disconnections in
               olivine, both of which are expected to occur along or near grain
               boundaries. Finally, I detail outstanding questions and research
               directions that will further our understanding of the crystalline
               specificities and paradoxes of olivine and olivine-rich rocks and
               ultimately their implications for the dynamics of Earth's upper

              the mechanical behaviour and the development of lattice preferred
              orientations. At 1473K, a pronounced strain hardening is observed
              associated with grain elongation and limited dynamic
              recrystallisation along grain boundaries. The lattice preferred
              orientations of relict olivine grains generally follow the strain
              ellipsoid up to a shear strain of 1.1. Both [100] and [001] axes
              have peaks parallel to the maximum grain elongation direction. At
              1573K and shear strains >0.6, a moderate strain softening was
              associated with the development of significant dynamic
              recrystallisation. The lattice preferred orientation of relict
              olivine grains is characterised by point maxima with [100] axes
              parallel to the shear direction, [010] axes perpendicular to the
              shear plane, and [001] axes within the shear plane and
              perpendicular to the shear direction. The results suggest that at
              1473K both the b=[100] dislocations and b=[001] dislocations
              contribute to plastic deformation; at 1573K dynamic
              recrystallisation relaxed constraints on deformation at grain
              boundaries, leading to a situation where a single slip system with
              b=[100] dislocations controls the rheology and the fabric. The
              lattice orientations of dynamically recrystallised olivine grains
              were measured using the electron backscatter diffraction
              technique. The measurements reveal a bimodal pattern of [100]
              axes: one parallel to the shear direction and the other
              perpendicular to the maximum principal compressive stress.
              Analysis of the results shows that the development of the
              stress-controlled orientations is closely associated with grain
              boundary migration processes during recrystallisation and growth.
              As a consequence, the direction of the fastest seismic velocity
              would not be parallel to the shear direction for olivine
              aggregates when grain boundary migration has a strong influence on
              the fabric.",

              compression-induced micromechanical extensile behaviors of the
              crystalline rock. Alteration of the grain morphology heterogeneity
              from the euhedral to anhedral was quantitatively depicted by the
              fractal dimension. Meanwhile, heterogeneity of grain-scale
              mechanical properties was also considered, which depended on the
              stress state. We identified two effects related to the crystal
              habit that affected mechanical behaviors of the crystalline rock:
              the tensile stress concentration effect (TSCE) and the grain
              boundary interlocking effect (ILE). These two effects counteracted
              with each other with modulating the crystal habit. The stress
              threshold of the crack initiation of the crystalline rock
              generally decreased as the crystal habit modulated from the
              euhedral to anhedral, while the stress thresholds of the crack

              crystal habit had important influences on the stress distributions
              and further affected the progressive failure characteristics of
              the crystalline rock. The intergranular cracking was throughout
              the whole process while the transgranular failure mainly emerged
              adjacent to the crack damage stage. With modulating the crystal
              habit from the euhedral to anhedral, the number of the
              transgranular failure zone first decreased then increased. We
              acquired new insights into the microcracking behaviors of the

              substructure was studied in a type 316L austenitic stainless
              steel, deformed in rolling at 900 degrees C to true strain levels
              of about 0.3 and 0.7. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and
              transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used in the
              investigation and a comparison of the substructural
              characteristics obtained by these techniques was made. At the
              lower strain level, the deformation substructure observed by EBSD
              appeared to be rather poorly developed. There was considerable
              evidence of a rotation of the pre-existing twin boundaries from
              their original orientation relationship, as well as the formation
              of highly distorted grain boundary regions. In TEM, at this strain
              level, the substructure was more clearly revealed, although it
              appeared rather inhomogeneously developed from grain to grain. The
              subgrains were frequently elongated and their boundaries often
              approximated to traces of [111] slip planes. The corresponding
              misorientations were small and largely displayed a non-cumulative
              character. At the larger strain, the substructure within most
              grains became well developed and the corresponding misorientations
              increased. This resulted in better detection of sub-boundaries by
              EBSD, although the percentage of indexing slightly decreased. TEM
              revealed splitting of some sub-boundaries to form fine microbands,
              as well as the localized formation of microshear bands. The
              substructural characteristics observed by EBSD, in particular at
              the larger strain, generally appeared to compare well with those
              obtained using TEM. With increased strain level, the mean subgrain
              size became finer, the corresponding mean misorientation angle
              increased and both these characteristics became less dependent on
              a particular grain orientation. The statistically representative
              data obtained will assist in the development of physically based
              models of microstructural evolution during thermomechanical
              processing of austenitic stainless steels.",

               records, 3D geomechanical–numerical modelling is applied to
               estimate the stress state in a volume. To assess the quality of
               the model results, the model uncertainties have to be quantified.
               We present an approach that provides the uncertainties of the six
               independent stress tensor components at each location in the
               model volume by an average value and its standard deviation. We
               explore the uncertainties introduced to the model results with
               respect to the stress magnitude data used for model calibration.
               We test our approach on a model of the Bavarian Molasse Basin
               which includes the area around Munich with many geothermal
               projects. In the test area, we find large uncertainties in the
               modelled magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress
               ($$\text{S}\_\text {Hmax}$$) in the order of 15–30\%. The
               uncertainties in the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress
               ($$\text{S}\_\text {hmin}$$) are smaller between 5 and 20\%. In
               connection with an adequate failure criterion, we compare our

               Aschheim/Feldkirchen/Kirchheim remained seismically quiet,
               induced seismicity was recorded in Poing. Our modelled
               undisturbed stress state was confirmed by these observations by
               showing in average a stable stress state in
               Aschheim/Feldkirchen/Kirchheim and a critical stress state in
               Poing. If the uncertainties in terms of two standard deviations
               are considered, this does not change. This demonstrates the

              the sheet, the grains which have survived the growth selection

              about 15° toward the upstream direction. This deviation is

              to the mechanical properties such as high ultimate tensile
              strength, high work hardening rate, and good ductility. Due to the
              composite structure and the wide field of applications of this
              steel type, a wide interest exists in corresponding virtual
              computational experiments. For a reliable modeling, the
              microstructure should be included. For that reason, in this paper
              we follow a computational strategy based on the definition of a
              representative volume element (RVE). These RVEs will be
              constructed by a set of tomographic measurements and mechanical
              tests. In order to arrive at more efficient numerical schemes, we
              also construct statistically similar RVEs, which are characterized
              by a lower complexity compared with the real microstructure but
              which represent the overall material behavior accurately. In
              addition to the morphology of the microstructure, the
              austenite–martensite transformation during the steel production
              has a relevant influence on the mechanical properties and is
              considered in this contribution. This transformation induces a
              volume expansion of the martensite phase. A further effect is
              determined in nanoindentation test, where it turns out that the
              hardness in the ferrite phase increases exponentially when
              approaching the martensitic inclusion. To capture these gradient
              properties in the computational model, the volumetric expansion is
              applied to the martensite phase, and the arising equivalent
              plastic strain distribution in the ferrite phase serves as basis
              for a locally graded modification of the ferritic yield curve.
              Good accordance of the model considering the gradient yield
              behavior in the ferrite phase is observed in the numerical
              simulations with experimental data.",

              lacks a centralized platform for incorporating this constantly
              updating thermodynamic data into aqueous geochemical models. Here,
              we introduce PyGeochemCalc (PyGCC), a community-driven,
              open-source Python package that meets this need by providing a
              consolidated set of functions for calculating the thermodynamic
              properties of gas, aqueous, and mineral (including solid solutions
              and variable-formula clays) species, as well as reactions amongst
              these species, over a broad range of temperature and pressure
              conditions. The PyGCC package utilizes the revised
              Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state, and newly
              proposed density-based extrapolations based upon it, to calculate
              the thermodynamic properties of aqueous species; a choice of

              thermodynamic properties of minerals and gases. Additionally,
              PyGCC integrates these functions to generate thermodynamic
              databases for various geochemical programs, including the
              Geochemist's Workbench (GWB), EQ3/6, TOUGHREACT, and PFLOTRAN,

              the equations it relies on for calculating thermodynamic

              are tracked to inspect the tempo-spatial development of
              localization under contractional regimes. Typically, the porosity
              exerts the first-order control on the evolution of failure mode
              with confining pressure: the low-confinement response is always
              dilatant with the generation of axial split or shear band, and the
              high-confinement behaviors depend on porosity, where distributed
              cataclasis dominates at low porosity and collapsed pores often
              coalesce into a compaction band at high porosity. The nucleation
              and propagation of localization relate closely to the
              micro-cracking activity and energy budget, on which grain sorting,
              boundary constraint, mineralogy and cementation attributes have a
              direct impact. When the maximum grain size is not more than five
              times the minimum, the relative abundance of coarser grains
              facilitates the compaction localization, which is accompanied by a
              smaller magnitude in both fragmentation and energy release. The
              mineralogy and cementation generally affect the competition of
              tensile and shear cracking events on the grain interior and
              boundary, and have minor effect on the rupture morphology; the
              frictional boundary does little to the cracking rate while
              seriously impact the low-confinement performance. Numerical
              results suggest that the compaction band may originate from the

  abstract = "In a paper published in 1920, Bowen conceived of a situation where
              forces acting on a crystalline mesh could extract the liquid phase
              from the solid, and in doing so cause variations in chemistry
              distinct from the purely gravitational effects of fractional
              crystallisation. His paper was a call-to-arms to explore the role
              of deformation as a cause of variation in igneous rocks, but was
              never followed-up in a rigorous way. Inspired by this, we have
              developed a quantitative model showing how shear deformation of a
              crystallised dense magma (ϕ > 70\%) with poro-elastic properties
              is analogous to a granular material. The critical link between the
              mechanics and associated compositional changes of the melt is the
              degree to which the crystallising magma undergoes dilation (volume
              increase) during shear. It is important to note that the effect
              can only take place after the initial loose solid material has
              undergone mechanical compaction such that the grains comprising
              the rigid skeleton are in permanent contact. Under these
              conditions, the key material parameters governing the dilatancy
              effect are the physical permeability, mush strength, the shear
              modulus and the contact mechanics and geometry of the granular
              assemblage. Calculations show that dilation reduces the
              interstitial fluid (melt) pressure causing, in Bowen’s words, “the
              separation of crystals and mother liquor” via a suction effect. At
              shear strain rates in excess of the tectonic background,
              deformation-induced melt flow can redistribute chemical components
              and heat between regions of crystallising magma with contrasting
              rheological properties, at velocities far in excess of diffusion
              or buoyancy forces, the latter of course the driving force behind
              fractional crystallisation and viscous compaction. Influx of
              hotter, less evolved melt drawn internally from the same magma
              body into regions where crystallisation is more advanced
              (auto-intrusion), may result in reverse zoning and/or resorption
              of crystals. Because dilatancy is primarily a mechanical effect
              independent of melt composition, evolved, chemically distinct melt
              fractions removed at this late stage may explain miarolitic
              alkaline rocks, intrusive granophyres in basaltic systems and late
              stage aplites and pegmatites in granites (discontinuous
              variations), as proposed by Bowen. Post-failure instabilities
              include hydraulic rupture of the mush along shear zones governed
              by the angles of dilation and internal friction. On the
              macro-scale, a combination of dilatancy and fracturing may provide
              a means to extract large volumes of chemically evolved melt from
              mush columns on short (< 1000 year) geological timescales.",

              crucial to reveal the kinetics of the olivine (α)-spinel (γ) phase
              transformation under differential stress. To investigate the
              effect of microstructural properties on phase transformations,
              such as grain boundary energy and plastic strain, we conducted a
              phase-field simulation using germanate olivine, an analog of
              silicate olivine. We conducted simulations under various confining
              pressures of 1–5 GPa, temperatures of 1000 and 1200 K, with and
              without plastic strain, and various grain boundary energies. The
              volume fraction of spinel decreases as the overpressure (confining
              pressure) increases because the effect of the elastic strain
              energy owing to the large overpressure on spinel growth is larger
              than those of the interface mobility and chemical free energy. The
              spinel growth has two types: “spinel needle” parallel to the
              maximum compression direction and “spinel platelet” perpendicular
              to the maximum compression direction. The spinel needles
              constantly grow owing to the interface mobility controlled by the
              grain boundary diffusivity, whereas the spinel platelets grow
              while the plastic strain caused by the phase transformation and
              deformation decreases the elastic strain energy. The spinel growth
              produces further plastic strain; thus, the spinel growth
              progresses by this positive feedback between the transformation
              and deformation.",

               significantly elevated fluid pressure played a role in their
               formation. Natural hydrofractures are abundant in rocks and are
               often preserved as magmatic dykes or sills, and mineral-filled
               fractures or mineral veins. However, we focus on the formation
               and evolution of non-igneous hydrofractures. Here we review the
               basic theory of the role of fluid pressure in rock failure,
               showing that both Terzaghi’s and Biot’s theories can be
               reconciled if the appropriate boundary conditions are considered.
               We next discuss the propagation of hydrofractures after initial
               failure, where networks of hydrofractures may form or
               hydrofractures may ascend through the crust as mobile
               hydrofractures. As fractures can form as a result of both
               tectonic stresses and an elevated fluid pressure, we address the
               question of how to ascertain whether a fracture is a
               hydrofracture. We argue that extensional or dilational fractures
               that formed below c. 2–3 km depth are, under normal
               circumstances, hydrofractures, but at shallower depth they may,
               but must not be hydrofractures. Since veins and breccias are
               often the products of hydrofractures that are left in the
               geological record, we discuss these and critically assess which
               vein structures can, and which do not necessarily, indicate
               hydrofracturing. Hydrofracturing can suddenly and locally change
               the permeability in a rock by providing new fluid pathways. This
               can lead to highly dynamic self-organization of crustal-scale

              history and rheology, strain, vorticity and viscosity. Previous
              studies reveal that several factors, such as pebble shapes and
              concentrations, as well as material properties, affect
              conglomerate deformation. However, how pebble concentration and
              interaction between pebbles affect deformation is not understood
              very well. We use the 2D numerical modelling platform ELLE coupled
              to the full field crystal visco-plasticity code (VPFFT) to
              simulate the deformation of conglomerates with various viscosity
              contrasts between pebbles and matrix and different pebble
              concentrations, with both linear (stress exponent n = 1) and
              power-law (n = 3) viscous rheologies, under simple shear
              conditions up to a shear strain of ten. Pebbles can behave as
              effectively passive, deformable or effectively rigid. An increase
              in pebble concentrations/viscosity contrasts enhances pebble
              deformation, but reduces their rotation. A mean aspect ratio (Rf)
              - orientation (ϕ) plot is proposed to gain an estimate of pebble
              deformation behaviour and the amount of bulk strain. Closely
              spaced rigid or deformable pebbles can form clusters that
              mechanically act as single inclusions. Rigid clusters rotate and
              survive for only short strain increments, whereas the more stable
              deformable ones keep on elongating with minor rotation. We provide
              a natural example of deformed conglomerates from the Wutai
              Mountains, North China Craton. These consist of
              banded-iron-formation (BIF) pebbles embedded in a schistose
              matrix. Using the mean Rf-ϕ plot, a finite strain of ∼6 under
              simple shear could be determined. The viscosity of the pebbles is
              estimated at about 5–8 times that of the matrix for a linear
              rheology (n = 1), or 2 to 5 times if a power-law rheology with n =

              results highlight that during simple shear, if dynamic weakening

              quickly localized into an IWL, where an increasing proportion of
              weak material increases the interconnections between the IWLs,

              dynamic in time and space within a single deformation event.

               propagation direction, distribution of ground motions, and
               evolution of off-fault damage. Thus, analyzing elastic contrasts
               of bimaterial faults is important for understanding earthquake
               physics and related hazard potential. The effect of elastic
               contrast between isotropic materials on rupture dynamics is
               relatively well studied. However, most fault rocks are
               elastically anisotropic, and little is known about how the
               anisotropy affects rupture dynamics. We examine microstructures
               of the Sandhill Corner shear zone, which separates
               quartzofeldspathic rock and micaceous schist with wider and
               narrower damage zones, respectively. This shear zone is part of

               findings show that the horizontally polarized shear wave
               propagating parallel to the bimaterial fault (with fault-normal
               particle motion) is the slowest owing to the fault-normal
               compliance and therefore may be important in determining the
               elastic contrast that affects rupture dynamics in anisotropic
               media. Following results from subshear rupture propagation models
               in isotropic media, our results are consistent with ruptures
               preferentially propagated in the slip direction of the schist,
               which has the slower horizontal shear wave and larger

              LA-ICP-MSI of metals, trace elements or isotopes in tissues has
              been applied to a range of biological samples. Several LA-ICP-MSI
              studies have shown that metals have a highly compartmentalized

              of genetic diseases, intoxication, or malnutrition. Although metal
              imaging by LA-ICP-MSI is an established methodology, potential
              pitfalls in the determination of metal concentrations might result
              from erroneous calibration, standardization, and normalization. In
              addition, for simple display of final imaging results, most

  abstract = "Several numerical studies have been published in the past years
              speculating about the existence of plate tectonics on large
              exoplanets. They focus on aspects like the mass of a planet, the
              interior heating rate and the occurrence of water in the mantle.
              Different trends in the propensity for plate tectonics have been
              observed in particular when varying the planetary mass: with
              increasing mass the surface mobilization is found to be either
              more, equally or less likely than on Earth. These studies and
              their implications are, however, difficult to compare as they
              assume different initial conditions and parameter sets, and either
              neglect the pressure effect on the viscosity or assume a rather
              small influence of the pressure on the rheology. Furthermore, the
              thermal evolution of the planets (i.e. cooling of core and
              decrease in radioactive heat sources with time) is typically
              neglected. In our study, we use a 2D finite volume code and apply
              a pseudo-plastic rheology. We investigate how a strong
              pressure-dependence of the viscosity influences not only the
              convective regime in the lower mantle, but also in the upper
              mantle and hence the likelihood to obtain plate tectonics. We
              examine how our results change when either assuming a wet or a dry
              rheology or when employing different initial conditions, focussing
              on the initial temperature in the lower mantle and at the
              core-mantle boundary. We find that the initial temperature
              conditions have a first-order influence on the likelihood of plate
              tectonics on large exoplanets. For standard literature values for
              initial temperatures of super-Earths, surface mobilization is less
              likely than on Earth, for warm initial temperature the result is
              vice versa. Simulations that neglect the time-dependence of
              internal heat sources on the other hand tend to lead to an
              increasing likelihood of plate tectonics with increasing mass.
              Finally, our investigations suggest that a wet rheology does not
              necessarily favor plate tectonics, but – depending on the
              reference viscosity – may rather lead to a stagnant-lid regime.",

              sized rocky planets has necessitated approaches to address their
              surface conditions, degassing, tectonics, and habitability. One of
              the key unknowns is the spectrum of compositional endmembers,
              particularly in geophysically critical elements such as Fe
              (relative to Si), and heat producing elements (HPEs), including U,
              Th and K. The fractional distribution of these elements determines
              core size, gravity, and internal temperatures, which govern the
              geodynamics of rocky planets. Whilst the relative proportions of
              these elements can vary enormously in solar-system bodies, on long
              timescales, galactic chemical evolution (GCE) predicates the
              availability of these elements for building rocky planets.
              Existing models demonstrate a systematic dilution of heat
              producing elements over time, and an increase in Fe/Si due to
              increased Type Ia supernova activity since galaxy formation. Here
              we test the consequences of these trends for terrestrial planet
              behaviour. We assume an Earth-type planet – i.e., planets that
              accreted similarly to Earth, and inherited elements in a similar
              partitioning ratio as Earth to the Sun. We varied their Fe/Si
              ratios, and thus core size, and use a mineral physics package to
              calculate internal structures, physical properties, and gravity.
              Planets forming early in the Milky Way's history tend to have low
              Fe/Si ratios, and thus small cores, although elevated HPE budgets.
              The configuration of convection in planets that have large mantle
              fractions relative to the Earth tends to focus stress in the
              lithosphere and promote tectonic activity. Together with lower
              gravity, and thus weaker surface faults, plate tectonic behaviour
              is enhanced in small-core planets. In contrast, planets forming
              currently have higher Fe/Si, core size, higher gravity, and a
              lower propensity to plate tectonics. Our results imply a
              high-propensity for plate tectonics on Earth-sized planets early
              in galactic history, with the tendency for tectonics diminishing
              as the galaxy evolved.",

               development, rise, and fall. Next, we discuss its empirical and
               conceptual problems, and indicate how they are addressed in
               contemporary research on perceptual grouping and figure-ground
               organization. In particular, we review the principles of
               grouping, both classical (e.g., proximity, similarity, common
               fate, good continuation, closure, symmetry, parallelism) and new
               (e.g., synchrony, common region, element and uniform
               connectedness), and their role in contour integration and
               completion. We then review classic and new image-based principles

               experience and attention, and how it relates to shape and depth

               perception, we conclude by evaluating what modern vision science
               has offered compared to traditional Gestalt psychology, whether
               we can speak of a Gestalt revival, and where the remaining

               balance; observed trace element variations, on the other hand,

               the formation of large impact craters but is one that must be
               validated with observational evidence. Quantitative analysis of
               damage and deformation in the target surrounding an impact event
               provides a promising means of validation for numerical models of
               terrestrial impact craters, particularly in cases where the final
               pristine crater morphology is ambiguous or unknown. In this
               paper, we discuss the aspects of the behavior of brittle
               materials important for the accurate simulation of damage and
               deformation surrounding an impact event and the care required to
               interpret the results. We demonstrate this with an example
               simulation of an impact into a terrestrial, granite target that
               produces a 10 km‐diameter transient crater. The results of the
               simulation are shown in terms of damage (a scalar quantity that
               reflects the totality of fragmentation) and plastic strain, both
               total plastic strain (the accumulated amount of permanent shear
               deformation, regardless of the sense of shear) and net plastic
               strain (the amount of permanent shear deformation where the sense
               of shear is accounted for). Damage and plastic strain are both
               greatest close to the impact site and decline with radial
               distance. However, the reversal in flow patterns from the
               downward and outward excavation flow to the inward and upward
               collapse flow implies that net plastic strains may be
               significantly lower than total plastic strains. Plastic strain in
               brittle rocks is very heterogeneous; however, continuum modeling
               requires that the deformation of the target during an impact
               event be described in terms of an average strain that applies
               over a large volume of rock (large compared to the spacing
               between individual zones of sliding). This paper demonstrates
               that model predictions of smooth average strain are entirely
               consistent with an actual strain concentrated along very narrow
               zones. Furthermore, we suggest that model predictions of total
               accumulated strain should correlate with observable variations in
               bulk density and seismic velocity.",

              of Mg-suite and ferroan anorthosite lithologies that have
              interacted with a S-rich vapor. Numerous studies have speculated
              on the composition and source of these “fluids”, their capability
              for the transport of vapor-mobilized elements, and the scale and
              environment under which these types of process occurred. These
              models all assumed a Moon with a very “dry” mantle, crust, and
              surface. The olivine in these lithologies is partially to totally
              replaced by troilite and low-Ca pyroxene. The troilite makes up
              30–54vol\% of the troilite+low-Ca pyroxene pseudomorphs after
              olivine. Other silicates and oxides in the assemblages have
              experienced post-magmatic reequilibration (pyroxene exsolution,
              recrystallization, “exsolution” of ilmenite in spinel). The
              troilite also occurs in veins cross cutting individual phases and
              metamorphic textures. The sulfide veining and replacement features
              are restricted to individual clasts and do not cut across the
              matrix surrounding the clasts, and thus predate the
              breccia-forming event. The proportion of troilite to low-Ca
              pyroxene and silicate chemistries indicate that simple reactions
              (such as olivine+S2↔low-Ca pyroxene+troilite+O2) do not adequately
              represent the replacement process. The sulfides have compositions
              that are similar to those found in mare basalts. In particular,
              the sulfides generally are enriched in Co relative to Ni.
              Exsolution of Ni–Co–Cu in the sulfides is distinctly different
              between the breccias and mare basalts and suggests a different
              cooling or crystallization (melt versus vapor) history. The sulfur
              isotopic composition of the vein and replacement troilite ranges
              from approximately δ34S=−1.0‰ to −3.3‰. Based on our observations,
              it appears that the model suggested by Norman et al. (1995) is the
              most appropriate for the origin of the troilite veining and
              troilite–pyroxene pseudomorphs after olivine. Our data add
              significant definition to this model. This process occurs in the
              relatively shallow lunar crust on a scale that involves vapor
              interaction with multiple plutonic lithologies of various ages and
              compositions. These reactions occur at distinct conditions of fS2,
              fO2, and temperature. The reacting vapor is S-rich, and perhaps
              low in H. The reduction of the oxides in the clasts was not a
              product of H-streaming as has been suggested for similar textures
              in lunar rocks, but more likely related to “S-streaming”. These
              vapors had the capability to transport chalcophile–siderophile
              elements. However, a proportion of the minor elements making up
              the troilite (Fe, Ni, Co) did come directly from the olivine being
              replaced. Further, there is evidence to suggest minor mobility of
              Mg from the olivine pseudomorphs into the adjacent pyroxene. One
              of the heat sources driving the transport of elements is closely
              tied to the emplacement of magmas into the shallow lunar crust.
              These intrusions were either the source for the S or provided heat
              to remobilized troilite already in the lunar crust. The process
              that drove the derivation of the S-rich volatiles was instrumental
              in fractionating the isotopic composition of S. The enrichment of
              S32 in the vapor phase may be attributed to either the stable S
              species during degassing (COS, S2 and CS2) or the high-temperature
              partial breakdown of troilite in the shallow crust.",

              anomalously high Mn/Mg olivines and pyroxenes from the Hughes 009
              unbrecciated ureilite (here termed the “Hughes cluster”). Some

              lithic clasts, using a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) with

              along the CCAM line, covering the range for unbrecciated
              ureilites, and show a good anti-correlation with mineral mg\#.
              SIMS analysis identifies one ferroan lithic clast as an
              R-chondrite, while a second ferroan clast is unlike any known
              meteorite. An exotic enstatite grain is derived from an enstatite

              the source of most meteorites. Observational evidence, however,
              does not indicate that differentiated bodies or their fragments
              were ever common there. This view is also difficult to reconcile
              with the fact that the parent bodies of iron meteorites were as
              small as 20 km in diameter and that they formed 1-2 Myr earlier

              small planetesimals to melt early in Solar System history by the

               equilibration of newly accreted material with Earth's mantle.
               Conversely, if independent age constraints for the formation of
               Earth's core are available, the 182W excess of Earth's mantle
               relative to chondrites can be used to constrain the degree of
               metal-silicate equilibration during Earth's accretion. Provided
               that the Moon-forming event is the last large impact, the latest
               time core formation can have ceased in Earth is provided by the
               age of the oldest lunar samples and is ∼70–100 Myr after the
               start of the solar system. If, as seems likely, the impactor's
               core did not re-equilibrate extensively with the silicate
               proto-Earth, the Moon cannot have formed before ∼40 Myr resulting
               in an age of the Earth and the Moon of 40–70 Myr after the start
               of the solar system. The 182W excess of the bulk silicate Earth
               relative to chondrites of ∼2ε units is substantially smaller than
               the 15–20εW range expected if Earth's core formed by merging of
               metal cores of early differentiated planetesimals, indicating
               significant re-homogenization of newly accreted planetesimals
               with Earth's mantle. In continuous core formation models that
               assume growth of Earth at an exponentially decreasing rate, more
               than ∼70\% of the newly accreted material must have equilibrated
               with Earth's mantle. Including the Moon-forming impact into these
               models such that Earth was 89\% accreted at the time of the
               impact and 10\% was added by the impactor implies more than ∼50\%
               metal-silicate equilibration in the silicate proto-Earth. Such
               high degrees of metal-silicate equilibration can only be achieved
               if core formation occurred by the physical separation of liquid
               metal from mostly molten silicate providing strong support for
               the hypothesis of a terrestrial magma ocean. Model calculations
               show that formation of a magma ocean by a late Moon-forming
               impact is not sufficient in removing radiogenic 182W from Earth's
               mantle that would have accumulated as a result of early core
               formation. A high degree of metal-silicate equilibration of at
               least 50\% must have been established prior to Moon formation,
               implying that metal segregation in the proto-Earth already
               occurred in a magma ocean. Therefore, the Moon-forming impact is
               not the only impact that led to the formation of a magma ocean,
               indicating multiple formations of magma oceans or a protracted
               life-time of the magma ocean.",

               growth, planetary cores grow by accretion of single pebble
               species. The growing planet may reach the so-called pebble
               isolation mass, at which it induces a pressure bump that blocks
               inward drifting pebbles exterior to its orbit, thereby stalling
               core growth by pebble accretion. In recent hydrodynamic
               simulations, pebble filtration by the pressure bump depends on
               several parameters including core mass, disc structure, turbulent
               viscosity and pebble size. We have investigated how accretion of
               multiple, instead of single, pebble species affects core growth
               rates, and how the dependence of pebble isolation mass on
               turbulent viscosity and pebble size sets the final core masses.
               We performed numerical simulations in a viscous one-dimensional
               disc, where maximal grain sizes were regulated by grain growth,
               fragmentation and drift limits. We confirm that core growth rates
               and final core masses are sensitive to three key parameters: the
               threshold velocity at which pebbles fragment on collision, the
               turbulent viscosity and the distribution of pebble species, which
               yield a diversity of planetary cores. With accretion of multiple
               pebble species, planetary cores can grow very fast, reaching over
               30–40 ME in mass. Potential cores of cold gas giants were able to
               form from embryos initially implanted as far as 50 au. Our
               results suggest that accretion of multispecies pebbles could
               explain: the estimated 25–45 ME heavy element abundance inside
               Jupiter’s core; the massive cores of extrasolar planets; the disc

               that are accreted to form planetary embryos and planetary cores
               is debated. First, models assumed that the main part of planetary
               cores came from large-sized planetesimals, but other more recent
               models are based on the accretion of small-sized pebbles.Aims.
               The goal of this paper is to compute the maximum mass a growing
               planetary embryo can reach depending on the size of accreted
               planetesimals or pebbles, and to infer the possibility of growing
               the cores of giant planets and giant planets themselves.Methods.
               We computed the internal structure of the gas envelope of
               planetary embryos to determine the core mass that is necessary to
               bind an envelope large enough to destroy planetesimals or pebbles
               while they are gravitationally captured. We also considered the
               effect of the advection wind originating from the protoplanetary
               disk, following the results of Ormel et al. (2015, MNRAS, 447,
               3512).Results. We show that for low-mass pebbles the envelope is
               large enough to destroy and vaporize pebbles completely before
               they can reach the core once the planetary embryo is larger than
               a fraction of the Earth mass. The material constituting pebbles
               is therefore released in the planetary envelope and is later on
               dispersed in the protoplanetary disk if the advection wind is
               strong enough. As a consequence, the growth of the planetary
               embryo is stopped at a mass that is so low that Kelvin-Helmholtz
               accretion cannot lead to the accretion of significant amounts of
               gas. For larger planetesimals, a similar process occurs but at
               much higher mass, on the order of ten Earth masses, and it is
               followed by rapid accretion of gas.Conclusions. If the effect of
               the advection wind is as efficient as described in Ormel et al.
               (2015), the combined effect of the vaporization of accreted
               solids in the envelope of forming planetary embryos and of this
               advection wind prevents the growth of the planets at masses lower
               than or similar to the Earth mass in the case of formation by
               pebble accretion, up to a distance on the order of 10 AU. In the
               case of formation by accretion of high-mass planetesimals, the
               growth of the planetary core is limited at masses on the order of
               ten Earth masses. However, in contrast to the case of pebble
               accretion, further growth is still possible and proceeds either
               through the accretion of gas or through the accretion of solids
               that are destroyed in the planetary envelope when the effect of
               the advection wind has ceased and the planetary Hill radius
               becomes comparable to the disk scale height.",

               questions in our knowledge of the Solar System's early state.
               Because no known nebular processes separate iron from silicates
               during planetesimals formation, it is believed that the
               terrestrial planets formed from planetesimals containing
               approximately solar abundances of iron and silicates. At some
               stage of planetary growth, iron separated from the silicates to
               form cores. We propose that once a planet reaches a certain
               minimum mass, large impacts characteristic of late accretion can
               trigger core formation. Our model overcomes two major
               difficulties of core formation: large-scale segregation of molten
               iron into diapirs and displacement of the cold, elastic interior
               of the planet by the iron. Large, high-speed impacts on
               relatively large planets (>∼1023 kg) result in melting beyond the
               transient crater's dimensions, forming a large, intact melt
               region with a radius up to a few times the projectile's radius.
               Both the iron and silicates melt. Iron rapidly settles to the
               melt region's base because of its high density. The accumulated
               iron forms a large, negatively buoyant mass that stresses the
               underlying material. If the generated stress is larger than the
               maximum long term stress that the cold interior can support, the
               iron rapidly flows to the planet's center, displacing the cold
               interior and forming (or adding to) a core. To investigate, we
               developed an analytical melting model based on the Hugoniot
               equations, the empirical relationship for the decline of particle
               velocity with distance, and the linear shock-particle velocity
               relationship. Using this melting model coupled with a Monte Carlo
               simulation of accretion, we examined the ability of giant impacts
               to trigger core formation. The melt forms an intact region only
               if the melt fraction that is not excavated from the crater is
               >∼0.5–0.6. This does not occur until a planet is of approximately
               lunar mass or greater and is struck by a planetesimal of about
               one-tenth its mass. If the maximum long-term stress that the
               planet's cold interior can withstand is 2 kbar, consistent with
               conditions at the Earth's surface, planets must be approximately
               the mass of Ceres before impacts induce core formation. However,
               core formation occurs only if an intact melt region forms at this
               stage and if planetesimals with impact speeds greater than about
               7.25 km sec−1 exist during this stage of accretion, both of which
               are unlikely. If the approach velocity of the planetesimals is
               small, the planet must grow to ∼1024 kg (∼16−14 the Earth's mass)
               before a giant impact will induce core formation. If a small
               fraction of the planetesimals have approach velocities greater
               than a few kilometers per second, impact-induced core formation
               occurs in planets with masses between 1 and 6 × 1023 kg. By the
               time a planet grows to Mars size, it has a nearly 100\%
               probability that a giant impact triggered core formation. A
               Mercury-mass planet has about a 75\% probability. Giant impacts
               do not explain whole-body differentiation of asteroid-sized
               planets.",

               segregation might be expected to essentially quantitatively
               remove these elements from planetary mantles. Yet the abundances
               of these elements estimated for Earth's primitive upper mantle
               (PUM) and the martian mantle are broadly similar, and only about
               200 times lower than those of chondritic meteorites. In contrast,
               although problematic to estimate, abundances in the lunar mantle
               may be more than twenty times lower than in the terrestrial PUM.
               The generally chondritic Os isotopic compositions estimated for
               the terrestrial, lunar and martian mantles require that their
               long-term Re/Os ratios were within the range of chondritic
               meteorites. Further, most HSE in the terrestrial PUM also appear
               to be present in chondritic relative abundances, although Ru/Ir
               and Pd/Ir ratios are slightly suprachondritic. Similarly
               suprachondritic Ru/Ir and Pd/Ir ratios have also been reported
               for some lunar impact melt breccias that were created via large
               basin forming events. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to
               account for the HSE present in Earth's mantle. These hypotheses
               include inefficient core formation, lowered metal-silicate D
               values resulting from metal segregation at elevated temperatures
               and pressures (as may occur at the base of a deep magma ocean),
               and late accretion of materials with chondritic bulk compositions
               after the cessation of core segregation. Synthesis of the large
               database now available for HSE in the terrestrial mantle, lunar
               samples, and martian meteorites reveals that each of the main
               hypotheses has flaws. Most difficult to explain is the similarity
               between HSE in the Earth's PUM and estimates for the martian
               mantle, coupled with the striking differences between the PUM and
               estimates for the lunar mantle. More complex, hybrid models that
               may include aspects of inefficient core formation, HSE
               partitioning at elevated temperatures and pressures, and late
               accretion may ultimately be necessary to account for all of the
               observed HSE characteristics. Participation of aspects of each
               process may not be surprising as it is difficult to envision the
               growth of a planet, like Earth, without the involvement of each.",

               the same as the volatile composition of the incident

               an initial shock pressure of about 11 GPa and complete

               concentration of dissolved O is near 9 wt\% and the dihedral
               angle is 52°, allowing small amounts of sulfide melt to form an
               interconnected network in olivine-rich rocks and to migrate via
               porous flow. These results indicate that sulfide melt is likely
               to be mobile at current upper mantle fO2 and fS2 conditions. In
               mantle peridotite, the addition or removal of sulfide melt by
               porous flow will variably fractionate Re/Os, U/Pb, and Th/Pb
               ratios because Os and Pb are more chalcophile than Re, U, and Th.
               The Re/Os ratio of the peridotite is especially sensitive to this
               process. The mobility of sulfide melt at oxidizing conditions
               implies that the addition of oxidized chondritic material during
               the later stages of the accretion of the Earth may have
               facilitated the segregation of core-forming material by porous
               flow if temperatures were in excess of the sulfide solidus.",

               to surface via mid-ocean-ridge-basalt (MORB) magmatism. The
               variations of MORBs are determined both by the heterogeneity of
               mantle source and the melt migration processes from mantle source
               to seafloor. However, before the MORB magmas enter crust, the
               role of the major melt migration passageways within the mantle
               (dunite channel systems) in regulating the compositions of MORBs
               has been rarely evaluated, especially from the perspective of
               Re-Os isotopes. Here, we report new Re-Os isotopic compositions
               of base-metal sulfides (BMS), chromites and dunites from dunite
               lenses with low spinel Cr\# [Cr3+/(Cr3++Al3+) ≤0.66] (products of
               interaction between MORB-like melts and upper-mantle
               harzburgites) from the Zedang ophiolite (South Tibet). Rhenium-Os
               isotopic compositions of low-Cr\# dunites from the Samail and
               Wadi Tayin massifs (typical MOR segments) of the Oman ophiolite
               are also shown for comparison to reveal the melt plumbing
               processes at mantle depths beneath mid-ocean ridges.
               Mineralogical evidence suggests that the Zedang sulfides and
               desulfurized alloy portions were originally precipitated as
               monosulfide solid solutions. The highly variable 187Os/188Os
               initial ratios (0.1191-0.1702) and low 187Re/188Os (<0.22) of the
               sulfides suggest that the chromite acted as a sink for Os-bearing
               sulfides, aggregating discrete Os components with heterogeneous
               isotopic signatures from asthenospheric or lithospheric mantle
               into dunite channels. The Zedang chromites and dunites show
               187Os/188Os ratios similar to the primitive upper mantle (PUM),
               except for two dunites with sub-PUM ratios, reflecting the
               contribution of Os balanced by smaller volumes of Os-rich,
               unradiogenic sulfides (likely nucleating on Os nanoparticles) and
               larger volumes of Os-poor radiogenic BMS. Such isotopic
               heterogeneity, despite with less variation, has been observed in
               dunite channels from the Samail and Wadi Tayin massifs of the
               Oman ophiolite and present-day mid-ocean ridges. Formation of
               dunite channels in the upper mantle thus can aggregate Os-bearing
               sulfides with chromite, leaving high Re/Os components into the
               residual MOR melts. Once such channel systems were built up at
               the Moho transition zone, the newly incoming MOR magmas would
               preferentially dissolve the volumetrically abundant radiogenic
               BMS and retain Os-rich alloys/sulfides in the channels, further
               amplifying the Os-isotope mismatch observed between global
               oceanic crust (more radiogenic) and lithospheric mantle (less
               radiogenic). This study reveals that the long-distance reactive
               migration of melts from mantle source to at least Moho depths can
               result in strong Re-Os fractionation and isotopic mismatch
               between primary MORBs and mantle residues. It also shows that,
               unlike other lithophile tracers (e.g., Nd-Hf isotopes) whose
               signatures are almost completely transferred from mantle source
               to crust, the sub-crustal melt plumbing processes beneath
               mid-ocean ridges can be finely constrained by the multistage
               evolution of chalcophile and siderophile elements (e.g., Re-Os)
               and their isotopes (e.g., 187Re-187Os) with sulfides and
               chromites. Our study supports that the MORB compositions are
               actually regulated by their reactive migration processes occurred
               between melt generation at depth and eruption on seafloor.",

               Here we report the results of a series of deformation experiments
               on a sample of partially molten Kernouve H6 chondrite (T=900–1050
               °C) aimed at determining the siderophile concentrations and
               associated partition coefficients in both Fe–S–Ni–O quench and
               Fe–Ni metal as a function of degree of melting, and to provide
               insight into the melt segregation mechanism(s). The geochemical
               results show the S content in the segregated Fe-rich liquid metal
               decreases with increasing degree of melting. As the S content of
               the liquid metal also strongly affects the partitioning of highly
               siderophile elements between solid and liquid metal, an increase
               in porosity (Fe liquid melt fraction) from c. 5\% to 30\% lowers
               DSM/LM for HSE by several orders of magnitude. The relationship
               between melt fraction and porosity is used to compare the
               migration rate of liquid metal driven by buoyancy pressure
               gradients with a new theoretical model of melt segregation in a
               deforming porous medium that takes into account the coupling
               between volume strain (dilatancy) and shear stress. For buoyancy
               driven porous flow, highest transport velocities occur at highest
               porosities, implying the fastest flow velocities will carry
               Fe-rich liquid metal with low sulfur contents, preferentially
               enriched in incompatible HSEs. Predicted characteristic
               timescales of liquid metal transport due to buoyancy effects
               (diapirism and porous flow) for a c. 100 km-sized planetesimal
               are contrasted with shear-induced segregation velocities set up
               in response to external perturbations via impacts, an important
               process during the final stages of planetary accretion. A novel
               feature of our analysis is that liquid metal segregated
               previously into a planetary core by buoyancy instabilities (e.g.,
               porous flow or a raining mechanism), might be drawn locally back
               into the silicate lower mantle by pressure gradients linked to
               surface impacts providing a physical mechanism for return flow of
               siderophile elements across the CMB.",

               suggested to be initiated by deformation-assisted segregation of
               molten Fe–S through a crystalline peridotite matrix. In this

               the dihedral angle of the liquid phase on liquid
               interconnectivity. (i) High pressure experiments were performed
               on simplified systems consisting of olivine plus a small
               percentage of liquid FeS (dihedral angle ~75°) or gold (dihedral
               angle ~150°) at a temperature above the FeS/Au solidus but below
               the silicate solidus. Samples were deformed at high pressure in a
               deformation-DIA multianvil press at strain rates between 10−3 and
               10−6s−1. (ii) Optical in situ analogue experiments on norcamphor
               plus H2O (dihedral angle ~86°) were performed at room temperature
               to complement the d-DIA experiments. The crystalline matrix in

               migration assisted dislocation creep under the experimental
               conditions. Furthermore, the liquid pockets display a similar
               strain rate dependent behaviour in both sets of experiments: At
               high strain rates deformation is strongly localised by the liquid
               phase, and liquid interconnection and segregation occurs. At low
               strain rates the geometry of liquid pockets is controlled
               predominantly by surface tension and little elongation and
               interconnection occurs. We propose a new empirical scaling
               approach using the d-DIA results, which indicates that some
               degree of high dihedral angle liquid interconnection and
               segregation may be possible down to a few percent residual liquid
               under natural conditions for moderate dihedral angles
               (60°<Θ<90°). This, however, would not suffice for efficient
               core–mantle segregation and an additional mechanism, such as a
               magma ocean, would be required.",

               networks at low volume fractions. To characterize the change in
               connectivity of metal melt in response to deformation, we used
               optical microscopy and electron microprobe analyses to
               investigate the microstructures of samples of olivine+gold
               sheared to shear strains of >200\%. Deformation causes the
               development of a strong melt-preferred orientation 13–15° to the
               shear plane and antithetic to the shear direction. This
               melt-preferred orientation consists of previously isolated
               pockets of gold melt that have connected into networks extending
               for many grain lengths, as well as linear “trails” of isolated
               pockets. Melt was observed to have migrated 125–200 μm in
               response to pressure gradients induced by serrations in the
               pistons in contact with the sample, proving that finite
               permeability exists during deformation well below the critical
               melt fraction for connectivity. Consideration of the balance
               between differential and interfacial stresses on melt pockets
               indicates that melt channels formed in response to deformation
               can drain rocks to a very small melt fraction in a direction
               subparallel to the shear direction, stranding less melt than
               drainage under hydrostatic conditions. Therefore, core formation
               by percolative flow of non-wetting melt in actively deforming
               planets and planetesimals may be accomplished more efficiently
               than previously believed. In addition, core material entrained in
               the mantle at the core–mantle boundary will be strongly aligned
               sub-horizontally in regions of horizontal shear and have little
               to no permeability in the vertical direction, providing a

               meteorites and in the main-group pallasites (pmg), closely
               related to high-Au IIIAB irons. Pallasites seem to have formed by
               the intrusion of a highly evolved metallic magma from a
               IIIAB-like core into fragmented olivine of the overlying dunite
               mantle. High Cr contents are commonly encountered during the
               analyses of metallic samples of high-Au IIIAB irons and
               main-group pallasites, an indication that Cr contents were high
               in the intruding liquid and that Cr behaved as an incompatible
               element during the crystallization of the IIIAB magma, contrary
               to expectations based on the negative IIIAB Cr-Ni and Cr-Au
               trends among low-Au IIIAB irons. In a region about 10 cm across
               in the Brenham main-group pallasite massive chromite fills the
               interstices between olivine grains, the site normally occupied by
               metal in Brenham and other pallasites. The massive chromite may
               have formed as a late cumulus phase; because Fe-Ni was also
               crystallizing, its absence in the chromite-rich region suggests a
               separation associated with differences in liquid buoyancy. The
               coexisting chromite and olivine are zoned; in the olivine FeO is
               highest in pallasitic (olivine-metal) regions, lowest in rims
               adjacent to chromite, and intermediate in the cores of these
               olivines. Chromite shows the opposite zoning, with the highest
               FeO contents at grain edges adjacent to olivine. The observed
               gradients are those expected to form by Fe-Mg exchange between
               olivine and chromite during slow cooling at subsolidus
               temperatures. Compared to normal Brenham, contents of phosphoran
               olivine and phosphates are higher in the chromitic pallasitic
               region. We also report data for large-to-massive chromites
               present in pmg Molong and in high-Au IIIAB Bear Creek that, like
               Brenham, formed from a highly evolved magma. The Bear Creek
               chromite has a much lower Mg content than that in the pallasites,
               implying that, in the pmg, the Mg was extracted from the olivine
               during high-temperature reaction with the precipitating chromite.
               There are other circumstantial arguments indicating that Cr was
               incompatible in the metal during the crystallization of the IIIAB
               magma, with the concentration in the residual magma rising from
               an initial value of about 300 μg/g to a value around 700 μg/g
               when Bear Creek and Brenham were formed. We consider possible
               explanations for these negative Cr-Au and Cr-Ni trends and find
               the most probable one to be that they reflect sampling artefacts
               resulting from analysts avoiding visible chromite (and the
               commonly associated phase FeS) when choosing metal samples.",

               to solve the equations governing the motion of the atmosphere and
               ocean, and describes how to develop a set of corresponding
               instructions for the computer as part of a code. Today's
               computers are powerful enough to allow 7-day forecasts within
               hours, and modern teaching of the subject requires a combination
               of theoretical and computational approaches. The presentation is
               aimed at beginning graduate students intending to become
               forecasters or researchers, that is, users of existing models or
               model developers. However, model developers must be well versed
               in the underlying physics as well as in numerical methods. Thus,
               while some of the topics discussed in the modeling of the
               atmosphere and ocean are more advanced, the book ensures that the
               gap between those scientists who analyze results from model
               simulations and observations and those who work with the inner
               works of the model does not widen further. In this spirit, the
               course presents methods whereby important balance equations in
               oceanography and meteorology, namely the advection-diffusion
               equation and the shallow water equations on a rotating Earth, can
               be solved by numerical means with little prior knowledge. The
               numerical focus is on the finite-difference (FD) methods, and
               although more powerful methods exist, the simplicity of FD makes
               it ideal as a pedagogical introduction to the subject. The book

               mass or more of material, enough to allow the asteroids to
               accrete on relatively short timescales. The present-day main
               belt, however, only contains ∼5×10−4 Earth masses. Numerical
               simulations suggest that this mass loss can be explained by the
               dynamical depletion of main belt material via gravitational
               perturbations from planetary embryos and a newly-formed Jupiter.
               To explore this scenario, we combined dynamical results from
               Petit et al. [Petit, J. Morbidelli, A., Chambers, J., 2001. The
               primordial excitation and clearing of the asteroid belt. Icarus
               153, 338–347] with a collisional evolution code capable of
               tracking how the main belt undergoes comminution and dynamical
               depletion over 4.6 Gyr [Bottke, W.F., Durda, D., Nesvorny, D.,
               Jedicke, R., Morbidelli, A., Vokrouhlický, D., Levison, H., 2005.
               The fossilized size distribution of the main asteroid belt.
               Icarus 175, 111–140]. Our results were constrained by the main
               belt's size–frequency distribution, the number of asteroid
               families produced by disruption events from diameter D>100km
               parent bodies over the last 3–4 Gyr, the presence of a single
               large impact crater on Vesta's intact basaltic crust, and the
               relatively constant lunar and terrestrial impactor flux over the
               last 3 Gyr. We used our model to set limits on the initial size
               of the main belt as well as Jupiter's formation time. We find the
               most likely formation time for Jupiter was 3.3±2.6Myr after the
               onset of fragmentation in the main belt. These results are
               consistent with the estimated mean disk lifetime of 3 Myr
               predicted by Haisch et al. [Haisch, K.E., Lada, E.A., Lada, C.J.,
               2001. Disk frequencies and lifetimes in young clusters.
               Astrophys. J. 553, L153–L156]. The post-accretion main belt
               population, in the form of diameter D≲1000km planetesimals, was
               likely to have been 160±40 times the current main belt's mass.
               This corresponds to 0.06–0.1 Earth masses, only a small fraction
               of the total mass thought to have existed in the main belt zone
               during planet formation. The remaining mass was most likely taken
               up by planetary embryos formed in the same region. Our results
               suggest that numerous D>200km planetesimals disrupted early in
               Solar System history, but only a small fraction of their
               fragments survived the dynamical depletion event described above.
               We believe this may explain the limited presence of iron-rich
               M-type, olivine-rich A-type, and non-Vesta V-type asteroids in
               the main belt today. The collisional lifetimes determined for
               main belt asteroids agree with the cosmic ray exposure ages of
               stony meteorites and are consistent with the limited collisional
               evolution detected among large Koronis family members. Using the
               same model, we investigated the near-Earth object (NEO)
               population. We show the shape of the NEO size distribution is a
               reflection of the main belt population, with main belt asteroids
               driven to resonances by Yarkovsky thermal forces. We used our
               model of the NEO population over the last 3 Gyr, which is
               consistent with the current population determined by telescopic
               and satellite data, to explore whether the majority of small
               craters (D<0.1–1km) formed on Mercury, the Moon, and Mars were
               produced by primary impacts or by secondary impacts generated by
               ejecta from large craters. Our results suggest that most small
               craters formed on these worlds were a by-product of secondary
               rather than primary impacts.",

               different distances to the sun. Their chemical diversity is
               reflected by compositionally variable meteorite groups from
               different parent bodies. There is general consensus that their
               formation location is roughly constrained by a dichotomy of
               nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies, relating carbonaceous (C)
               meteorite parent bodies to the outer protoplanetary disk and the
               non-carbonaceous (NC) parent bodies to an origin closer to the
               sun. It is a common idea, that in these inner parts of the
               protoplanetary disks, planetesimal accretion processes were
               faster. Testing such scenarios requires constraining formation
               ages of meteorite parent bodies. Although isotopic age dating can
               yield precise formation ages of individual mineral constituents
               of meteorites, such ages frequently represent mineral cooling
               ages that can postdate planetesimal formation by millions or tens
               of millions of years, depending on the cooling history of
               individual planetesimals at different depths. Nevertheless, such
               cooling ages provide a detailed thermal history which can be
               fitted by thermal evolution models that constrain the formation
               age of individual parent bodies. Here we apply state-of-the-art
               thermal evolution models to constrain planetesimal formation
               times particular in the outer solar system formation region of C
               meteorites. We infer a temporally distributed accretion of
               various parent bodies from 2 - 3 Ma) accretion of C planetesimals
               beyond the snow line which escaped severe planetesimal heating
               and volatile loss, hence, preserving their volatiles, especially
               water. Only this delayed formation of water-rich planetesimals
               allowed Earth to accrete sufficient water to become a habitable
               planet, preventing it from being a bone dry planet.",

               Northwest Africa (NWA) 12949 is a newly found mesosiderite

               cataclastic), compositionally consistent with diogenites and
               eucrites, have been identified in NWA 12949. However, these
               clasts have undergone different thermal histories, with cooling
               rates varying from ~0.0044?°C?year?1 to a few °C?h?1, and

              53Mn–53Cr decay system in olivine during cooling within meteorite
              parent body. The diffusion of Cr in olivine was found to be
              anisotropic, and effectively independent of fO2 between
              wüstite–iron buffer and two orders of magnitude above this buffer.
              The diffusion data were used to calculate the spatially averaged
              mean closure temperature of the 53Mn–53Cr decay system in olivine
              as function of the initial temperature, cooling rate and grain
              size, and also the closure age profile of this system in olivine

              olivine that is 10 Myr younger than the age of the solar system.
              The calculated cooling rate, which is 20–40°C/Myr at ∼985–1000°C,
              is in good agreement with the metallographic cooling rate at
              ∼500°C, when the two results are considered in terms of a cooling
              model in which the reciprocal temperature increases linearly with
              time. The inferred cooling rate of Omolon, which seems to be a
              sample from the core-mantle boundary, yields a burial depth of
              ∼30km in a parent body of at least ∼100km radius.",

              properties at finite temperatures to a one-shot task is developed.
              We report the improvement and automation of the stress-strain
              method, which relies on the averaged stresses from ab initio or
              classical calculations. Stresses obtained from strained crystal
              lattices at zero and finite temperatures can be directly extracted
              to fit the strain-stress relationship and get the elastic
              constants. Furthermore, the finite-temperature elastic constants
              can also be obtained by solving a system of overdetermined linear
              equations directly under constant pressure dynamics (NPT, NPH,
              etc.) within the stress-strain method, which does not require the
              equilibrated lattice as a prior condition. It is shown that the
              elastic constants converge quickly in constant pressure dynamics.
              This approach proves to be robust and can significantly reduce

              the meteorites Vermillion and Y8451, has been identified by
              petrologic, trace element, and oxygen isotopic data. Vermillion is
              a new 27 kg find from central Kansas with a texture that differs
              from main group (MG) and Eagle Station (ES) pallasites and
              consists of about (vol. \%) 86 FeNi metal and 14 silicates. The
              silicates are interspersed with metal along bands up to 1.5 cm
              wide within the metal host. These bands contain micron to cm-sized
              silicates, including rounded to subrounded olivine (up to 1.5 cm),
              as well as orthopyroxene, chromite, and merrillite. Y8451,
              previously described in [1], is texturally similar to MG
              pallasites and consists of FeNi metal, rounded to subangular
              olivine (up to 1 cm), pyroxene, chromite, and merrillite. Modally,
              Vermillion silicates consist of (vol. \%) about 93 olivine, 5 opx,
              1.5 chromite, 0.5 merrillite, while Y8451 silicates consist of
              about 94 olivine, 4.8 opx, 1.1 cpx, and 0.1 merrillite. Vermillion
              olivine (Fo(sub)(87.0-88.9)) is comparable to MG pallasite olivine
              [2], while that of Y8451 (Fo(sub)(88.8-89.8)) is slightly more
              magnesian than MG [1]. Vermillion pyroxene (En(sub)(86-88.5)
              Wo(sub)(0.5-2.5)) typically occurs along the rims of smaller
              olivine grains, although larger pyroxene inclusions (up to 1 mm)
              of the same composition are sometimes found within olivine grains.
              Y8451 has two types of opx, a lower-Ca opx (En(sub)(89.1)
              Wo(sub)(0.6)) with 0.3 wt\% CaO, and a higher-Ca opx
              (En(sub)(87.6-88.1) Wo(sub)(1.9-2.3)) with 1 wt\% CaO; the
              lower-Ca opx coexists with cpx (En(sub)(51.5-51.8)
              Wo(sub)(43.7-44.1)). The higher-Ca opx has a smoothly fractionated
              REE pattern increasing from 0.3 x CI for La to 2.5 x CI for Lu,
              with no Eu anomaly, and does not appear to be in equilibrium with
              cpx, which has a fairly flat REE pattern at about 5 x CI (Fig. 1).
              The lower-Ca opx, however, is in equilibrium with cpx. Merrillites
              in Y8451 and Vermillion have relatively flat LREE (2 x CI)
              patterns, with HREE increasing to near 100 x CI in Lu, and do not
              appear to be in equilibrium with the higher-Ca opx or cpx. FeNi
              metal in Vermillion has a fine octahedrite texture and contains 65
              micrograms/g Cr, 4.9 mg/g Co, 75 mg/g Ni, 130 micrograms/g Cu, 44
              micrograms/g Ga, 13 micrograms/g As, 0.7 micrograms/g W, 1.9
              micrograms/g Ir, and 1.4 micrograms/g Au. The metal is ungrouped
              and differs from MG or ES pallasite metal. Y8451 metal has not yet
              been analyzed. Oxygen isotopic compositions of olivine are similar
              in Vermillion (delta\textasciicircum(18)O=2.24,
              delta\textasciicircum(17)O=0.40, Delta\textasciicircum(17)O=-0.76)
              and Y8451 (delta\textasciicircum(18)O=2.26,
              delta\textasciicircum(17)O=0.41, Delta\textasciicircum(17)O=-0.77)
              and plot (Fig. 2) below the MG pallasite mass fractionation line
              (Delta\textasciicircum(17)O=-0.32). Pyroxene pallasites are
              clearly resolved from MG pallasites, as well as the
              acapulcoite-lodranite, and IAB-IIICD-winonaite groups.
              Conclusions: (1) Pyroxene pallasites constitute a new pallasite
              subgroup. (2) Application of the two-pyroxene thermometer [2] to
              Y8451 indicates an equilibration temperature of about 1000 degrees
              C. (3) The disequilibrium between silicates and phosphates is
              consistent with formation of merrillite by subsolidus reaction
              between metal and silicate where merrillite inherits the REE
              patterns of the olivine and orthopyroxene that probably formed as
              cumulates from a chondritic melt [3]. (4) The higher-Ca opx may be
              a xenocryst because of its disequilibrium pattern with the
              coexisting silicates. (5) The presence of pyroxene coexisting with
              olivine in pyroxene pallasites, in contrast to olivine alone in MG
              pallasites, may indicate a lower temperature of crystal
              accumulation for the pyroxene pallasites, assuming they both
              started from a similar chondritic melt. (6) The presence of three
              pallasite groups or grouplets may be indicative of three parent
              bodies, with only the MG pallasites related to the HED group. (7)
              Whatever the cause of the unusual metal-silicate relations in
              pallasites, this situation must have occurred in three different
              settings. References: [1] Yanai K. and Kojima H. (1995) Proc. NIPR

  abstract = "A number of distinct methodologies are available for determining
              the oxygen isotope composition of minerals and rocks, these
              include laser-assisted fluorination, secondary ion mass
              spectrometry (SIMS) and UV laser ablation. In this review we focus
              on laser-assisted fluorination, which currently achieves the
              highest levels of precision available for oxygen isotope analysis.
              In particular, we examine how results using this method have
              furthered our understanding of early-formed differentiated
              meteorites. Due to its rapid reaction times and low blank levels,
              laser-assisted fluorination has now largely superseded the
              conventional externally-heated Ni “bomb” technique for bulk
              analysis. Unlike UV laser ablation and SIMS analysis,
              laser-assisted fluorination is not capable of focused spot
              analysis. While laser fluorination is now a mature technology,
              further analytical improvements are possible via refinements to
              the construction of sample chambers, clean-up lines and the use of
              ultra-high resolution mass spectrometers. High-precision oxygen
              isotope analysis has proved to be a particularly powerful
              technique for investigating the formation and evolution of
              early-formed differentiated asteroids and has provided unique
              insights into the interrelationships between various groups of
              achondrites. A clear example of this is seen in samples that lie
              close to the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL). Based on the
              data from conventional oxygen isotope analysis, it was suggested
              that the main-group pallasites, the howardite eucrite diogenite
              suite (HEDs) and mesosiderites could all be derived from a single
              common parent body. However, high precision analysis demonstrates
              that main-group pallasites have a Δ17O composition that is fully
              resolvable from that of the HEDs and mesosiderites, indicating the
              involvement of at least two parent bodies. The range of Δ17O
              values exhibited by an achondrite group provides a useful means of
              assessing the extent to which their parent body underwent melting
              and isotopic homogenization. Oxygen isotope analysis can also
              highlight relationships between ungrouped achondrites and the more
              well-populated groups. A clear example of this is the proposed
              link between the evolved GRA 06128/9 meteorites and the
              brachinites. The evidence from oxygen isotopes, in conjunction
              with that from other techniques, indicates that we have samples
              from approximately 110 asteroidal parent bodies (∼60 irons, ∼35
              achondrites and stony-iron, and ∼15 chondrites) in our global
              meteorite collection. However, compared to the likely size of the
              original protoplanetary asteroid population, this is an extremely
              low value. In addition, almost all of the differentiated samples
              (achondrites, stony-iron and irons) are derived from parent bodies
              that were highly disrupted early in their evolution.
              High-precision oxygen isotope analysis of achondrites provides
              some important insights into the origin of mass-independent
              variation in the early Solar System. In particular, the evidence
              from various primitive achondrite groups indicates that both the
              slope 1 (Y\&R) and CCAM lines are of primordial significance. Δ17O
              differences between water ice and silicate-rich solids were
              probably the initial source of the slope 1 anomaly. These phases
              most likely acquired their isotopic composition as a result of UV
              photo-dissociation of CO that took place either in the early solar
              nebula or precursor giant molecular cloud. Such small-scale
              isotopic heterogeneities were propagated into larger-sized bodies,
              such as asteroids and planets, as a result of early Solar System
              processes, including dehydration, aqueous alteration, melting and
              collisional interactions. There is increasing evidence that
              chondritic parent bodies accreted relatively late compared to
              achondritic asteroids. This may account for the fact that apart
              from a few notable exceptions’ such as the aubrite-enstatite
              chondrite association, known chondrite groups could not have been
              the parents to the main achondrite groups.",

  abstract  = "Collisions between planetesimals at speeds of several kilometres
               per second were common during the early evolution of our Solar
               System. However, the collateral effects of these collisions are
               not well understood. In this paper, we quantify the efficiency of
               heating during high-velocity collisions between planetesimals
               using hydrocode modelling. We conducted a series of simulations
               to test the effect on shock heating of the initial porosity and
               temperature of the planetesimals, the relative velocity of the
               collision and the relative size of the two colliding bodies. Our
               results show that while heating is minor in collisions between
               non-porous planetesimals at impact velocities below 10kms−1, in
               agreement with previous work, much higher temperatures are
               reached in collisions between porous planetesimals. For example,
               collisions between nearly equal-sized, porous planetesimals can
               melt all, or nearly all, of the mass of the bodies at collision
               velocities below 7kms−1. For collisions of small bodies into
               larger ones, such as those with an impactor-to-target mass ratio
               below 0.1, significant localised heating occurs in the target
               body. At impact velocities as low as 5kms−1, the mass of melt
               will be nearly double the mass of the impactor, and the mass of
               material shock heated by 100K will be nearly 10 times the mass of
               the impactor. We present a first-order estimate of the cumulative
               effects of impact heating on a porous planetesimal parent body by
               simulating the impact of a population of small bodies until a
               disruptive event occurs. Before disruption, impact heating is
               volumetrically minor and highly localised; in no case was more
               than about 3\% of the parent body heated by more than 100K.
               However, heating during the final disruptive collision can be
               significant; in about 10\% of cases, almost all of the parent
               body is heated to 700K (from an initial temperature of ∼300K) and
               more than a tenth of the parent body mass is melted. Hence,
               energetic collisions between planetesimals could have had
               important effects on the thermal evolution of primitive materials
               in the early Solar System.",

               margin. Correlations between concentrations of Cr and Al exist
               for individual Brahin olivine grains, but do not hold over
               multiple grains, indicating a heterogeneous precursor. Al and Ti
               are correlated over multiple grains in Brahin, interpreted as Ti
               cations decorating pre-existing Al-defects. In Brenham olivine,
               similar geochemical trends exist, but the Cr–Al relationship
               probably represents both grain margin effects and pre-existing
               internal heterogeneity. The preservation of structure for
               elements which are normally fast diffusers in olivine hinges on
               coupled substitutions involving Al, which along with P diffuses
               much more slowly than most other elements under some conditions.
               Al concentrations in olivine are low and variable (3–33ppm) which
               is inconsistent with crystallisation from a normal silicate melt;
               Al-in-olivine thermometers indicate that pallasite olivine was
               formed in a low-temperature environment. Following its delivery
               to the magma ocean/core-mantle boundary, Al–P systematics were
               not substantially modified. Assuming diffusivities for Al and P
               that are similar to Si (since they reside in the same
               crystallographic site) and temperatures of 1600–1650K (from the
               melting point of the metal and the absence of orthopyroxene in
               pallasites) an upper limit on the residence time of pallasite
               olivine of ∼1Ma can be inferred by the persistence of trace
               element detail over scales of 100μm. Following the olivine–metal
               mixing event, homogeneous Ni and Co distributions were modified
               by diffusion; Cr and V were partially modified; Al and P were
               essentially unchanged.",

              silicates and iron, were then cooled to 500 C for l0 -l0 years,

               between 850 and 1150°C using oxygen-specific solid zirconia
               electrolytes at 105 Pa. The experimental apparatus consisted of a
               double-opposed electrolyte configuration with a CO-CO2 gas-mix
               bridging atmosphere. Four initial IOF measurements on Salta
               olivines revealed the effects of grain size and cell memory on
               experimental results; experiments with an IW cell memory and fine
               grain size (<45 μm) gave results most consistent with
               thermodynamic calculations. The IOF experimental results for
               olivine separates from Salta, Springwater, and Eagle Station fall
               within one log unit of the iron-wüstite oxygen buffer (IW). While
               these measurements may provide only an upper limit to the IOF of
               the pallasites, they correlate with the compositions of the
               olivine and metal in these samples: Salta, the most reduced
               pallasite studied (IW − 0.5 logfO2), contains Fa12.5 and
               Fe90.5Ni9.0; Springwater, of intermediate redox state (~IW),
               contains Fa18.0 and Fe87.5Ni12.1; Eagle Station, the most
               oxidized sample (IW + 0.5 logfO2), contains Fa20.5 and
               Fe85.0Ni14.6. Electron microbeam characterization of the starting
               materials and run products from these experiments have shown that
               olivine is the only phase present. Thermodynamic calculations of
               redox equilibria involving equilibrium pallasite assemblages are
               in good agreement with our experimental results and provide a
               lower limit to pallasite redox stability; others involving
               disequilibrium assemblages, suggest that pallasites experienced
               localized, late-stage oxidation and reduction effects.

               but some are rounded. The major axis of the lens-shaped
               inclusions is rigorously oriented along olivine (001), and the

               exsolution from the host olivine. The symplectites consist of

               silica. Contrast modulations having an average spacing of 4.4 nm
               occur within the chromite lamellae. Using a reaction- front
               model, we estimate that exsolution occurred over a period of 30
               to 100 min, suggesting rapid cooling at high temperature. The

               during heating following dislocation formation in a shock event,

              In this study, we report on the petrographic, mineralogical, and
              rare earth element abundances of the troilite-orthopyroxene
              intergrowths to constrain their origin and assess their
              implications for the diverse petrogenesis of diogenites. Two
              groups of troilite-orthopyroxene intergrowths with various grain
              sizes and mineral chemistry have been observed in NWA 7183. One
              group of intergrowths contains fine-grained (<5 μm) olivine and
              chromite as inclusions in orthopyroxene (10–20 μm in size). The
              other group, in which orthopyroxene is more fine-grained (<10 μm
              in size), is closely associated with coarse irregular olivine
              grains. The orthopyroxene grains in both groups of
              troilite-orthopyroxene intergrowths are depleted in Cr, Al, Ti,
              and Ca compared with diogenitic orthopyroxene. Based on the
              texture and mineral chemistry, we suggest that the two groups of
              troilite-orthopyroxene intergrowths formed via reactions between
              diogenitic olivine and S-rich vapors, probably at different
              temperatures. The fact that some of the intergrowths are included
              in diogenitic lithic clasts indicates that the formation of the
              host diogenite should postdate the formation of the majority of
              troilite-orthopyroxene intergrowths. This relationship further
              implies that not all of the diogenites are cumulates that directly
              crystallized from the Vestan magma ocean. Instead, they probably
              originated from partial melting and recrystallization of magma
              ocean cumulates. The replacement of olivine by troilite and
              orthopyroxene intergrowths can partly explain why the expected

              bodies derive from two genetically distinct reservoirs, which
              presumably were located inside (NC) and outside (CC) the orbit of
              Jupiter and remained isolated from each other for the first few
              million years of the solar system. Here we review the discovery of
              the NC–CC dichotomy and its implications for understanding the
              early history of the solar system, including the formation of
              Jupiter, the dynamics of terrestrial planet formation, and the
              origin and nature of Earth’s building blocks. The isotopic
              difference between the NC and CC reservoirs is probably inherited
              from the solar system’s parental molecular cloud and has been
              maintained through the rapid formation of Jupiter that prevented
              significant exchange of material from inside (NC) and outside (CC)
              its orbit. The growth and/or migration of Jupiter resulted in
              inward scattering of CC bodies, which accounts for the
              co-occurrence of NC and CC bodies in the present-day asteroid belt
              and the delivery of presumably volatile-rich CC bodies to the
              growing terrestrial planets. Earth’s primitive mantle, at least
              for siderophile elements like Mo, has a mixed NC–CC composition,
              indicating that Earth accreted CC bodies during the final stages
              of its growth, perhaps through the Moon-forming giant impactor.
              The late-stage accretion of CC bodies to Earth is sufficient to
              account for the entire budget of Earth’s water and highly volatile

              fundamental dichotomy among planetary materials. The
              “carbonaceous” chondrites, by virtue of high ε50Ti and high ε62Ni,
              as well as, especially for any given Δ17O, high ε54Cr, are
              separated by a wide margin from all other materials. The
              significance of the bimodality is further manifested by several
              types of meteorites with petrological-geochemical characteristics
              that suggest membership in the opposite category from the true
              pedigree as revealed by the stable isotopes. Ureilites, for
              example, despite having diversely low Δ17O and about the same
              average carbon content as the most C-rich carbonaceous chondrite,
              have clear stable-isotopic signatures of noncarbonaceous pedigree.
              The striking bimodality on the ε54Cr vs. ε50Ti and ε54Cr vs. Δ17O
              diagrams suggests that the highest taxonomic division in
              meteorite/planetary classification should be between carbonaceous
              and noncarbonaceous materials. The bimodality may be an extreme
              manifestation of the effects of episodic accretion of early solids
              in the protoplanetary nebula. However, an alternative, admittedly
              speculative, explanation is that the bimodality corresponds to a
              division between materials that originally accreted in the outer
              solar system (carbonaceous) and materials that accreted in the
              inner solar system (noncarbonaceous). In any event, both the Earth
              and Mars plot squarely within the noncarbonaceous
              composition-space. Applying the lever rule to putative mixing
              lines on the ε50Ti vs. ε54Cr and Δ17O vs. ε54Cr diagrams, the
              carbonaceous/(carbonaceous+noncarbonaceous) mixing ratio C/(C+NC)
              is most likely close to (very roughly) 24\% for Earth and 9\% for
              Mars. Estimated upper limits for C/(C+NC) are 32\% for Earth and
              18\% for Mars. However, the uncertainties are such that isotopic
              data do not require or even significantly suggest that Earth has
              higher C/(C+NC) than Mars. Among known chondrite groups, EH yields
              a relatively close fit to the stable-isotopic composition of

              that chondrules and matrix separated from the Allende CV3
              chondrite have complementary nucleosynthetic Mo isotope anomalies.
              These anomalies result from the enrichment of a presolar carrier
              enriched in s-process Mo into the matrix, and the corresponding
              depletion of this carrier in the chondrules. This carrier most
              likely is a metal and so the uneven distribution of presolar
              material probably results from metal–silicate fractionation during
              chondrule formation. The Mo isotope anomalies correlate with those
              reported for W isotopes on the same samples in an earlier study,
              suggesting that the isotope variations for both Mo and W are
              caused by the heterogeneous distribution of the same carrier. The
              isotopic complementary of chondrules and matrix indicates that
              both components are genetically linked and formed together from
              one common reservoir of solar nebula dust. As such, the isotopic
              data require that most chondrules formed in the solar nebula and
              are not a product of protoplanetary impacts. Allende chondrules
              and matrix together with bulk carbonaceous chondrites and some
              iron meteorites (groups IID, IIIF, and IVB) show uniform excesses
              in 92Mo, 95Mo, and 97Mo that result from the addition of supernova
              material to the solar nebula region in which these carbonaceous
              meteorites formed. Non-carbonaceous meteorites (enstatite and
              ordinary chondrites as well as most iron meteorites) do not
              contain this material, demonstrating that two distinct Mo isotope
              reservoirs co-existed in the early solar nebula that remained
              spatially separated for several million years. This separation was
              most likely achieved through the formation of the gas giants,
              which cleared the disk between the inner and outer solar system
              regions parental to the non-carbonaceous and carbonaceous
              meteorites. The Mo isotope dichotomy of meteorites provides a new
              means to determine the provenance of meteoritic and planetary

              transport of mass, resulting in mixing and homogenization of
              isotopically diverse materials that were contributed to the solar
              system from multiple stellar nucleosynthetic sources. The
              efficiency of this mixing, as well as its timescale can be
              quantified by determining nucleosynthetic isotope variations among
              meteorites and terrestrial planets. Here we present Mo isotopic
              data for a wide range of samples, including Ca–Al-rich inclusions,
              chondrites and differentiated meteorites, as well as martian and
              terrestrial samples. Most meteorites are depleted in s-process Mo
              relative to the Earth, and only the IAB–IIICD irons, angrites and
              martian meteorites have terrestrial Mo isotopic compositions. In
              contrast, most Ca–Al-rich inclusions are enriched in r-process Mo,
              but one inclusion is characterized by a large s-process deficit.
              Molybdenum isotopic anomalies in the bulk meteorites correlate
              with those in Ru exactly as predicted from nucleosynthetic theory,
              but no obvious correlation is apparent between Mo and Ni
              anomalies. Therefore, s-process Mo and Ru seem to be hosted in the
              same carrier, which must be distinct from the carrier responsible
              for isotopic anomalies in the Fe-group elements (Ni, Cr, Ti).
              Furthermore, the isotopic heterogeneity in Mo (and other elements)
              contrasts with the isotopic homogeneity for Hf and Os, indicating
              that different s-process carriers once existed in the early solar
              nebula and that only some of these were heterogeneously
              distributed. The Mo isotopic anomalies of meteorites and their
              components decrease over time and with increasing size of the
              parent bodies, providing evidence for a progressive homogenization
              of the solar nebula. However, the carbonaceous chondrites exhibit
              larger Mo anomalies than expected for their age, indicating that
              they received a greater portion of material from the outer solar
              system (where homogenization was slow) than other meteorite parent
              bodies and terrestrial planets. Compared to the meteorites, Earth
              is enriched in s-process Mo and must have accreted from material
              distinct from the meteorites. Combined Mo and O isotopic data show
              that the composition of the Earth cannot be reconstructed by any
              known combination of meteorites, implying that meteorites may be
              inappropriate proxies for the isotopic composition of the bulk
              Earth. This is exemplified by the covariation of 92Mo and 142Nd
              anomalies in chondrites, showing that the 142Nd deficit of
              chondrites compared to the accessible Earth may not unequivocally
              be interpreted as a signature of an early differentiation of the
              Earth. However, further high precision isotopic data are needed to
              evaluate the role of chondrites in defining the isotopic
              composition of the Earth.",

               in the ε60Ni versus ε62Ni diagram. The Ni isotope compositions of
               the volatile-depleted Group IVB irons are similar to those of the

               variability could reflect a radiogenic component from the decay

               meteorites with the same ε62Ni allows us to place upper limits on

               physical sorting within the protosolar nebula of different phases

              in the metal, either as alloying components or as tiny silicate or
              oxide inclusions. In the iron sulfide fraction, the Na content is
              high (>3 wt\%), suggesting chalcophile behaviour for Na during the
              shock event. The composition of the silicate glass reflects
              non-equilibrium melting of several silicate phases (olivine,
              pyroxene and plagioclase). Moreover, the FeO content is high
              compared to the FeO contents of the unmelted silicates. Some Fe
              redistribution took place between metal and silicate liquids
              during the shock event. The silicate glass also contains tiny iron
              sulfide precipitates which most probably originated by exsolution
              during quench, suggesting that the molten silicate retained
              significant amounts of S, dissolved at high temperature and high
              pressure. Based on these observations, we suggest that
              non-equilibrium phenomena may be important in determining the
              compositions of metal and silicate reservoirs during their
              differentiation.",

               These distortions are generally combinations of lattice rotations
               and elastic strains, but a lack of suitable observational
               techniques has prevented these components being mapped
               simultaneously and routinely in earth science laboratories.
               However, the technique of high-angular resolution electron
               backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) provides the opportunity to
               simultaneously map lattice rotation and elastic strain gradients
               with exceptional precision, on the order of 0.01° for rotations
               and 10?4 in strain, using a scanning electron microscope.
               Importantly, these rotations and lattice strains relate to
               densities of geometrically necessary dislocations and residual
               stresses. Recent works have begun to apply and adapt HR-EBSD to

               a summary of the technique, to identify caveats and targets for
               further development, and to suggest areas where it offers
               potential for major advances. In particular, HR-EBSD is well
               suited to characterizing the roles of different dislocation types
               during crystal plastic deformation and to mapping heterogeneous
               internal stress fields associated with specific deformation
               mechanisms/microstructures or changes in temperature, confining
               pressure, or macroscopic deviatoric stress. These capabilities

              a post-shock annealing episode. The Widmanstätten patterns in the

               determine their thermal and shock history and that of their
               parent asteroids. Maria Elena and Hammond were heated below
               approximately 700?750?°C, so that kamacite was recrystallized and
               taenite was exsolved in kamacite and was spheroidized in
               plessite. Both meteorites retained a record of the original
               Widmanstätten pattern. The other four, which show no trace of

               recrystallized to form 10?20??m wide homogeneous taenite grains.
               On cooling, kamacite formed on taenite grain boundaries with
               their close-packed planes aligned. Formation of homogeneous 20??m
               wide taenite grains with diverse orientations would have required
               as long as approximately 800?yr at 600?°C or approximately 1?h at
               1300?°C. All six irons contain approximately 5?10??m wide taenite
               grains with internal microprecipitates of kamacite and
               nanometer-scale M-shaped Ni profiles that reach approximately

               high-Ni martensite (α2) in taenite?the first occurrence in
               irons?appears to be a characteristic of strongly reheated irons.
               From our studies and published work, we identified four
               progressive stages of shock and reheating in IVA irons using
               these criteria: cloudy taenite, M-shaped Ni profiles in taenite,
               Neumann twin lamellae, martensite, shock-hatched kamacite,
               recrystallization, microprecipitates of taenite, and shock-melted
               troilite. Maria Elena and Fuzzy Creek represent stages 3 and 4,
               respectively. Although not all reheated irons contain evidence
               for shock, it was probably the main cause of reheating. Cooling

               we studied are representative, the IVA irons may have been
               shocked soon after they cooled below 200?°C at 4.5?Gyr in an
               impact that created a rubblepile asteroid with fragments from
               diverse depths. The primary cooling rates of the IVA irons and

  abstract  = "Abstract The Huoyanshan iron meteorite shower, recently found in
               the Gobi Desert of Hami, Xinjiang, China, has very high Ni (21.1
               wt\%) content and low Au (2.0 ppm), Ir (0.02 ppm), Ge (1.7 ppm),
               and Ga (1.1 ppm) contents, and was classified into IAB-sLH
               subgroup. The iron has a finest octahedrite structure of
               Widmanstätten pattern (the intergrowth of kamacite [α] and
               taenite [?]) with plessite matrix, and euhedral schreibersite
               (Sch) crystals exclusively enclosed in kamacite bands. The
               textural features suggest the following formation process: ??? +
               Sch?? + Sch + α, and then ??α2 + ?. The metallographic cooling
               rate of Huoyanshan iron was determined to be 3?50°C/Myr using
               both the taenite Ni profile-matching and taenite central Ni
               content methods, with the bandwidths corrected for
               crystallographic orientation by electron backscatter diffraction
               (EBSD). The cooling rate of Huoyanshan is consistent with other
               sLH irons and confirms the slow cooling history of the IAB low-Au
               subgroups. These slow cooling rates require immediate
               re-accretion with a thick brecciated fragments layer in the
               parent body after the impact melting event. The depleted but
               unfractionated Re, Os, Ir, Ru, and Pt and the enriched Pd and Au
               abundances of Huoyanshan iron and other sLH subgroup irons show
               complementary feature to that of refractory metal nuggets in Ca-,
               Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), which could be explained by extracting
               the metallic Fe-Ni with HSE predominantly remained in CAIs from a
               CAI-bearing asteroid. The very high Ni content of sLH subgroup
               and its Mo isotope evidence (Worsham et al., 2017,
               https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.02.044) suggest it has an
               oxidized parent body with non-carbonaceous chondrite-like
               precursor composition. We propose that the sLH subgroup was
               produced by impact melting of a LL like and CAI-bearing asteroid,
               followed by fast burying of thick and porous silicate breccia.",

               formation of the Widmanstätten pattern in iron meteorites and
               propose a new mechanism for low P meteoritic metal. These
               mechanisms can also be used to explain how the metallic
               microstructures developed in chondrites and stony-iron
               meteorites. The Widmanstätten pattern in high P iron meteorites
               forms when meteorites enter the three-phase field α + ? + Ph via
               cooling from the ? + Ph field. The Widmanstätten pattern in low P
               iron meteorites forms either at a temperature below the (α +
               ?)/(α + ? + Ph) boundary or by the decomposition of martensite
               below the martensite start temperature. The reaction ? ? α + ?,
               which is normally assumed to control the formation of the
               Widmanstätten pattern, is not applicable to the metal in
               meteorites. The formation of the Widmanstätten pattern in the
               vast majority of low P iron meteorites (which belong to chemical
               groups IAB-IIICD, IIIAB, and IVA) is controlled by mechanisms
               involving the formation of martensite α2. We propose that the
               Widmanstätten structure in these meteorites forms by the reaction
               ? ? α2 + ? ? α + ?, in which α2 decomposes to the equilibrium α
               and ? phases during the cooling process. To determine the cooling
               rate of an individual iron meteorite, the appropriate formation
               mechanism for the Widmanstätten pattern must first be
               established. Depending on the Ni and P content of the meteorite,
               the kamacite nucleation temperature can be determined from either
               the (? + Ph)/(α + ? + Ph) boundary, the (α + ?)/(α + ? + Ph)
               boundary, or the Ms temperature. With the introduction of these
               three mechanisms and the specific phase boundaries and the
               temperatures where transformations occur, it is no longer
               necessary to invoke arbitrary amounts of under-cooling in the
               calculation of the cooling rate. We conclude that martensite
               decomposition via the reactions ? ? α2 ? α + ? and ? ? α2 + ? ? α
               + ? are responsible for the formation of plessite in irons and
               the metal phases of mesosiderites, chondrites, and pallasites.

               embedded in an Fe-Ni matrix with 9–10 wt\% Ni and low-Ir (45

               understanding the development of the Widmanstatten pattern in
               iron meteorites, we have redetermined the Fe-Ni-P phase diagram
               from 0 to 100 pct Ni, 0 to 16.5 wt pct P, in the temperature
               range 1100° to 550°C. Long term heat treatments and 130 selected
               alloys were used. The electron microprobe was employed to measure
               the composition of the coexisting phases directly. We found that
               the fourphase reaction isotherm, where α+ liq ⇌ γ+ Ph, occurs at
               1000° ± 5°C. Above this temperature the ternary fields α+ Ph +
               liq and α+ γ+ liq are stable and below 1000°C, the ternary fields
               ⇌+ γ + Ph and γ + Ph + liq are stable. Below 875°C a eutectic
               reaction, liq → γ + Ph, occurs at the Ni-P edge of the diagram.
               Altogether nineteen isotherms were determined in this study. The
               phase boundary compositions of the two-and three-phase fields are
               listed and are compared with the three binary diagrams. The α + γ
               + Ph field expands in area in each isotherm as the temperature
               decreases from 1000°C. Below 800°C the nickel content in all
               three phases increases with decreasing temperature. The
               phosphorus solubility in α and γ decreases from 2.7 and 1.4 wt
               pct at 1000°C to 0.25 and 0.08 wt pct at 550°C. The addition of
               phosphorus to binary Fe-Ni greatly affects the α/α + γ and γ/α +
               γ boundaries below 900°C. It stabilizes the α phase by increasing
               the solubility of nickel (α/α +γ boundary) and above 700°C, it
               decreases the stability field of the γ phase by decreasing the
               solubility of nickel(@\#@ γ/α + γ boundary). However below 700°C,
               phosphorus reverses its role in γ and acts as a γ stabilizer,
               increasing the nickel solubility range. The addition of
               phosphorus to Fe-Ni caused significant changes in the nucleation
               and growth processes. Phosphorus contents of 0.1 wt pct or more
               allow the direct precipitation ofa from the parent γ phase by the
               reaction γ ⇌ α + γ. The growth rate of the α phase is
               substantially higher than that predicted from the binary
               diffusion coefficients.",

               within olivine in a mantle peridotite xenolith from the V. Grib
               kimberlite pipe (Arkhangelsk diamondiferous province). In
               contrast to micro/nano-inclusions in diamonds, the studied CMIs
               are quite large (up to 50 µm), so that the mineral composition of
               the CMIs can be determined via conventional analytical
               approaches, e.g., Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron
               microscopy. Garnet peridotite is a coarse-grained mantle rock
               that equilibrates at 3.3 GPa and 750 °C (corresponding to a depth
               of ~100 km). The CMIs are therefore tiny snapshots of melt that
               existed in the shallow lithospheric mantle and were entrapped in
               olivine. In total, nineteen mineral species were identified among
               the daughter magmatic minerals of the CMIs. Various Na-K-Ca-,
               Na-Ca-, Na-Mg-, Ca-Mg-, Mg- and Ca-carbonates; Na-Mg-carbonates
               with the additional anions Cl−, SO42− and PO43−; alkali sulfates;
               chlorides; phosphates; sulfides; oxides; and silicates were
               established. Within the mineral assemblage, carbonates were
               predominant, with their abundance being more than 62 vol.\%. The
               CMIs contained twelve alkali-rich minerals; nine of them were
               Na-bearing and showed bulk molar (Na + K)/Ca ≥ 1. The CMIs’
               parental melt was an alkali-rich carbonate liquid that contained
               low amounts of SiO2 (≤9.6 wt\%) and H2O (≤2.6 wt\%). According to
               our estimates, the time of complete equilibration between olivine
               within the healed cracks and host olivine in the mantle at the
               calculated P-T parameters for the studied xenolith should be no
               more than several years. Based on this geologically short time
               span, a genetic link between the studied CMIs and the magmatism
               that formed the V. Grib kimberlite pipe is suggested.",

               polished mounts in reflected light microscopy, scanning electron
               microscope (SEM), and electron microprobe (EMP). The sulfide
               phases are, by decreasing order of abundance, nickeliferous (0–3
               wt\% Ni) pyrrhotite with an average composition M 0.88±0.01 S (M
               = Fe+Ni+Co+Cu+Mn), nickeliferous pyrite (0–2.5 wt\% Ni),
               pentlandite, millerite, and unidentified Cu sulfides. Pyrrhotite
               is enclosed inside silicate melt inclusions in olivine and
               disseminated as polyhedral or near spherical blebs in
               intergranular spaces between cumulus and postcumulus silicates
               and oxides. This sulfide is considered to be a solidification
               product of magmatic sulfide melt. The pyrrhotite Ni/Fe ratios lie
               within the range expected for equilibration with the coexisting
               olivine at igneous temperatures. Pyrite occurs only as
               intergranular grains, heterogeneously distributed between the
               different pieces of the Chassigny meteorite. Pyrite is
               interpreted as a by-product of the low- T (200 °C) hydrothermal
               alteration events on Mars that deposited Ca sulfates + carbonates
               well after complete cooling. The shock that ejected the meteorite

               blebs were fractured and disrupted into subgrains by shock
               metamorphism. The negligible amount of intergranular sulfides and
               the lack of solitary sulfide inclusions in cumulus phases
               (olivine, chromite) indicate that, like other martian basalts so
               far studied for sulfur, the parental melt of Chassigny achieved
               sulfide-saturation at a late stage of its crystallization
               history. Once segregated, the pyrrhotite experienced a
               late-magmatic oxidation event that reequilibrated its
               metal-to-sulfur ratios.",

              earthquake nucleation, the initiation of subduction zones and the
              formation of mineral deposits. The importance of this poorly
              understood feedback is further highlighted by evidence for
              shear-zone-controlled advective flow of fluids in the ductile
              lower crust and the recognition that deformation-induced
              grain-scale porosity is a key to large-scale geodynamics. Fluid
              migration in the middle crust cannot be explained in terms of
              classical concepts. The environment is considered too hot for a
              dynamic fracture-sustained permeability as in the upper crust, and
              fluid pathways are generally too deformed to be controlled by
              equilibrium wetting angles that apply to hotter, deeper
              environments. Here we present evidence that mechanical and
              chemical potentials control a syndeformational porosity generation

              tomography and scanning electron microscopy observations allow us

              permeable porosity is dynamically created by viscous

              controlled by the explicit role of the rate of entropy production

              microprocesses. The model explains fluid transfer through the

              required for plate tectonics, the formation of giant ore deposits,
              mantle degassing and earthquake nucleation. Our findings provide a

  abstract = "Mantle viscous strain localization is often attributed to
              feedbacks between grain boundary sliding (GBS) and phase mixing,
              as GBS could promote mixing through grain switching, and phase
              mixing would enhance grain-size-sensitive granular flow through
              grain boundary pinning. However, although GBS and phase mixing are
              intimately related, recent data show that GBS alone cannot end-up
              with randomly mixed phases. Here we show natural observations of
              an ultramylonitic shear zone from the Ronda peridotite (Spain)
              where both GBS and phase mixing occur. Microprobe analyses and
              coupled EDX/EBSD data first document enrichment in pyroxenes and
              amphibole concomitant with both phase mixing and complete
              randomization of the olivine fabric in fine-grained layers (5-20
              microns) where strain has been localized. Both the fabric
              randomization and some microstructural observations indicate that
              these layers mostly deformed by granular flow, i.e., by GBS. Based
              on petrological pseudo-sections, we also show that phase
              enrichment does not result from metamorphic reaction, but instead
              from dissolution-precipitation phenomena. Finally, we document in
              adjacent areas a change of olivine fabric geometry that highlights
              syn-tectonic water draining towards fine-grained layers. While
              olivine fabric switches from E-type (moderately hydrated fabric)
              to C-type (highly hydrated fabric) towards fine-grained layers, it
              changes from E-type to D-type (highly hydrated fabric) in
              coarse-grained bands between E/C-type layers. Altogether, our
              findings suggest that water converges as a result of GBS-induced
              creep cavitation and subsequent granular fluid pump in
              fine-grained layers. We propose that phase mixing originates here
              from such a creep cavitation through dissolution-precipitation of
              secondary phases in newly formed cavities, giving rise to a key
              process for the relationships between GBS and phase mixing, and
              hence, for the origin of viscous strain localization in the upper

              cause the membrane to squeeze the internal grains, inducing
              dilation and jamming. Applications of this phenomenon have ranged
              from universal gripping to adaptive mobility. Previously, the
              combination of this jamming phenomenon with the ability to
              transport grains across multiple soft actuators for shape morphing
              has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, the authors
              demonstrate the use of hollow glass spheres as granular media that
              functions as a jammable ``quasi-hydraulic'' fluid in a fluidic
              elastomeric actuator that better mimics a key featur of animal

  abstract = "Viking orbiter images show grooves and chains of pits crossing the
              surface of Phobos, many of which converge toward the large crater
              Stickney or its antipode. Although it has been proposed that the
              pits and grooves are chains of secondary craters, their morphology
              and geometric relations suggest that they are the surface traces
              of fractures in the underlying solid body of Phobos. Several
              models have been proposed to explain the pits, of which the most
              plausible are gas venting and drainage of regolith into open
              fractures. the latter mechanism is best supported by the image
              data and is the mechanism studied in this investigation. Drainage
              pits and fissures are modeled experimentally by using two rigid
              substrate plates placed edge to edge and covered by uniform
              thicknesses of dry fragmental debris (simulated regolith).
              Fracture extension is simulated by drawing the plates apart,
              allowing drainage of regolith into the newly created void. A
              typical drainage experiment begins with a shallow depression on
              the surface of the regolith, above the open fissure. Increased
              drainage causes local drainage pits to form; continued drainage
              causes the pits to coalesce, forming a cuspate groove. The
              resulting experimental patterns of pits and grooves have
              pronounced similarities to those observed on Phobos.
              Characteristics such as lack of raised rims, linearity of grooves
              and chains of pits, uniform spacing of pits, and progression from
              discrete pits to cuspate grooves are the same in the experiments
              and on Phobos. In contrast, gas-venting pits occur in irregular
              chains and have raised rims. These experiments thus indicate that
              the Phobos grooves and pits formed as drainage structures. The pit
              spacing in an experiment is measured at the time that the maximum
              number of pits forms, prior to groove development. The average pit
              spacing is compared to the regolith thickness for each material.
              Regression line fits indicate that the average spacing of drainage
              pits in unconsolidated, noncohesive regolith is nearly equal to
              the thickness of regolith and appears to gbe independent of the
              angle of repose, within the resolution of our experiments. This
              provides a simple means of estimating regolith thickness where
              drainage pits are present. On Phobos, two locations differing by
              90 degrees in longitude have average pit spacings that suggest
              regolith thicknesses of 290 and 300 m, suggesting that large areas
              of Phobos have a nearly uniform regolith thickness of
              approximately 300 m.",

               suggests that mass and energy accumulation are dominated by a few
               large impacts. An important thermal consequence of such impacts
               is melting and formation of a large melt pond. If the planet's
               isostatic adjustment time scale is short compared to the magma
               pond's cooling time scale, the melt may be extruded onto the
               surface and form a magma ocean of approximately uniform depth.
               Although a giant impact striking at 10?15 km s?1 deposits enough
               energy to melt the entire planet, the distribution of that energy
               is important in determining the thermal outcome of the collision.
               We examine the thermal effects of giant impacts by estimating the
               melt volume generated by the initial shock wave and corresponding
               magma ocean depths. Additionally, we examine the effects of the
               planet's initial temperature on the generated melt volume. The
               Hugoniot curve plotted in pressure-entropy space is used to
               determine the shock pressure required to completely melt the
               material. For room temperature dunite, this pressure is about 150
               GPa and the partial melt region is narrow. For dunite initially
               at the solidus temperature, this pressure is about 115 GPa. The
               partial melt region extends throughout the planet. Once the
               melting pressure is known, an impact melting model based on the
               second Hugoniot equation, the linear shock-particle velocity
               relationship, and the empirical particle velocity-distance
               relationship is used to estimate the radial distance melting
               occurred from the impact site. Once the distance is found, the
               melt region's geometry determines the associated melt volume.
               Partial melt volume is also estimated. The melt fraction that is
               not excavated during crater formation is estimated and magma
               ocean depths resulting from both excavated and retained melt are
               calculated. The model is also used to estimate the fraction of a
               planet melted by the initial shock wave. Nominal conditions of
               the Moon-forming giant impact (projectile/planet mass = 0.14,
               impact speed = 15 km s?1) generate melting of 30?65\% of the
               planet depending on its initial temperature. Whole planet melting
               requires projectile/planet mass ratios of > 0.4 for a 15 km s?1
               impact if the planet was near its solidus before the impact.
               Isostatic relaxation may generate a significant volume of
               additional melting.",

               heating in collisions is not fully understood. We have conducted
               a series of shock physics simulations to quantify oblique heating
               processes, and find that both impact angle and target curvature
               are important in quantifying the amount of heating in a
               collision. We find an expression to estimate the heating in an
               oblique collision compared to that in a vertical incidence
               collision. We have used this expression to quantify heating in
               the Rhealsilvia-forming impact on Vesta, and find that there is
               slightly more heating in a 45° impact than in a vertical impact.
               Finally, we apply these results to Monte Carlo simulations of

               account for the natural variation in impact angle, as the amount
               of heating was well approximated by a fixed impact angle of 45°.
               However, for disruptive impacts, this natural variation in impact
               angle should be accounted for, as around a quarter of bodies were
               globally heated by at least 100 K in a variable-angle model, an

                   an important step in the planet formation process.
                   Planetesimals are the seeds of both terrestrial planets and
                   the solid cores of gas and ice giants forming by core
                   accretion. Left-over planetesimals in the form of asteroids,
                   trans-Neptunian objects and comets provide a unique record of
                   the physical conditions in the solar nebula. Debris from
                   planetesimal collisions around other stars signposts that the
                   planetesimal formation process, and hence planet formation,
                   is ubiquitous in the Galaxy. The planetesimal formation stage
                   extends from micrometer-sized dust and ice to bodies which
                   can undergo run-away accretion. The latter ranges in size
                   from 1 km to 1000 km, dependent on the planetesimal
                   eccentricity excited by turbulent gas density fluctuations.
                   Particles face many barriers during this growth, arising
                   mainly from inefficient sticking, fragmentation and radial
                   drift. Two promising growth pathways are mass transfer, where
                   small aggregates transfer up to 50\% of their mass in
                   high-speed collisions with much larger targets, and fluffy
                   growth, where aggregate cross sections and sticking
                   probabilities are enhanced by a low internal density. A wide
                   range of particle sizes, from mm to 10 m, concentrate in the
                   turbulent gas flow. Overdense filaments fragment
                   gravitationally into bound particle clumps, with most mass
                   entering planetesimals of contracted radii from 100 to 500
                   km, depending on local disc properties. We propose a hybrid
                   model for planetesimal formation where particle growth starts
                   unaided by self-gravity but later proceeds inside
                   gravitationally collapsing pebble clumps to form
                   planetesimals with a wide range of sizes.",

               is to estimate the corresponding shock pressure conditions.
               However, the temperature variability of shock metamorphism is
               equally important and can result in a diverse and heterogeneous
               set of shock features in samples with a common overall shock
               pressure. In particular, high-pressure (HP) minerals, which were
               previously used as a solid indicator of high shock pressure in
               meteorites, require complex pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t)
               histories to form and survive. First, parts of the sample must be
               heated to melting temperatures, at high pressure, to enable rapid
               formation of HP minerals before pressure release. Second, the HP
               minerals must be rapidly cooled to below a critical temperature,
               before the pressure returns to ambient conditions, to avoid
               retrograde transformation to their low-pressure polymorphs. These
               two constraints require the sample to contain large temperature
               heterogeneities, e.g. melt veins in a cooler groundmass, during
               shock. In this study, we calculated shock temperatures and
               possible P-T paths of chondritic and differentiated
               mafic-ultramafic rocks for various shock pressures. These P-T
               conditions and paths, combined with observations from shocked
               meteorites, are used to constrain shock conditions and P-T-t
               histories of HP-mineral bearing samples. The need for rapid
               thermal quench of HP phases requires a relatively low bulk-shock
               temperature and therefore moderate shock pressures below ~ 30
               GPa, which matches the stabilities of these HP minerals. The
               low-temperature moderate-pressure host rock generally shows
               moderate shock-deformation features consistent with S4 and, less
               commonly, S5 shock stages. Shock pressures in excess of 50 GPa in
               meteorites result in melt breccias with high overall post-shock
               temperatures that anneal out HP-mineral signatures. The presence
               of ringwoodite, which is commonly considered an indicator of the
               S6 shock stage, is inconsistent with pressures in excess of 30
               GPa and does not represent shock conditions different from S4
               shock conditions. Indeed, ringwoodite and coexisting HP minerals
               should be considered as robust evidence for moderate shock
               pressures (S4) rather than extreme shock (S6) near whole-rock
               melting.",

              error of the oldest solar system particles, apparently requiring a
              mechanism for segregation of metals to the cores of planetesimals
              within 1.5million years of initial condensation. Currently
              favoured models involve equilibrium melting and gravitational
              segregation in a static, quiescent environment, which requires
              very high early heat production in small bodies via decay of
              short-lived radionuclides. However, the rapid accretion needed to
              do this implies a violent early accretionary history, raising the
              question of whether attainment of equilibrium is a valid
              assumption. Since our use of the Hf–W isotopic system is
              predicated on achievement of chemical equilibrium during core
              formation, our understanding of the timing of this key early solar
              system process is dependent on our knowledge of the segregation
              mechanism. Here, we investigate impact-related textures and
              microstructures in chondritic meteorites, and show that
              impact-generated deformation promoted separation of liquid FeNi
              into enlarged sulfide-depleted accumulations, and that this
              happened under conditions of thermochemical disequilibrium. These
              observations imply that similar enlarged metal accumulations
              developed as the earliest planetesimals grew by rapid collisional
              accretion. We suggest that the nonmagmatic iron meteorites formed
              this way and explain why they contain chondritic fragments in a
              way that is consistent with their trace element characteristics.
              As some planetesimals grew large enough to develop partially
              molten silicate mantles, these enlarged metal accumulations would
              settle rapidly to form cores leaving sulfide and small metal
              particles behind, since gravitational settling rate scales with
              the square of metal particle size. Our model thus provides a
              mechanism for more rapid core formation with less radiogenic
              heating. In contrast to existing models of core formation, the
              observed rarity of sulfide-dominant meteorites is an expected
              consequence of our model, which promotes early and progressive
              separation of metal and sulfide. We suggest that the core
              formation models that assume attainment of equilibrium in the Hf–W
              system underestimate the core formation time.",

              core and the silicate mantle interact physically and chemically.
              Many geophysical anomalies such as low shear velocity and high
              electrical conductivity have been observed at the bottom of the
              mantle. Perturbations in the Earth's rotation rate at decadal time
              periods require the existence of a thin conductive layer with a
              conductance of 108 S. Substantial additions of molten iron from
              the outer core into the mantle may produce these geophysical
              anomalies. Although iron enrichment by penetration has only been
              observed in (Mg,Fe)O, the second dominant mineral in the lower
              mantle, the penetration process leading to iron enrichment in the
              silicate mantle has not been experimentally confirmed. In this
              study, high-pressure and high-temperature experiments were
              conducted to investigate the penetration of molten iron alloy into
              lower mantle phases; postspinel, polycrystalline bridgmanite and
              polycrystalline (Mg,Fe)O. At the interface between (Mg,Fe)O
              aggregate and molten iron alloy, liquid metal penetrated the
              (Mg,Fe)O aggregate along grain boundaries and formed a thin layer
              containing metal-rich blobs. In contrast, no penetration of molten
              iron alloy was observed at the interface between molten iron alloy
              and silicate phases. Penetration of liquid iron alloy into the
              (Mg,Fe)O aggregate is caused by the capillarity phenomenon or
              Mullins–Sekerka instability. Neither mechanism occurs at the
              boundary of pure polycrystalline MgO, indicating that the FeO in
              (Mg,Fe)O plays an essential role in this phenomenon. Infiltration
              of molten iron alloy along grain boundaries (capillarity
              phenomenon) is the dominant process and precedes penetration due
              to the Mullins–Sekerka instability. The capillarity phenomenon is
              governed by the balance of forces between surface tension and
              gravity. In the case where the ultralow velocity zone (ULVZ) with
              a low shear velocity is composed of Fe-rich (Mg,Fe)O, the maximum
              penetration distance of molten iron alloy by capillary rise is
              limited to 20m. The addition of iron-rich melt to the base of the
              mantle is therefore unlikely to be the main cause of the high
              conductance of the CMB region predicted from decadal variation of
              the length of day. Furthermore, the absence of molten iron alloy
              penetration into silicate phases does not allow an extensive
              modification of the chemical composition of the mantle by
              core–mantle interaction.",

              Melting experiments on chondritic compositions suggest that melts
              produced by ≲20\% partial melting are rich in silica and alkali
              elements. Such melts are highly viscous (≳103Pa⋅s), and
              percolation models predict that they would only migrate negligible
              distances over timescales of 1–10Myr. After these timescales, a
              planetesimal would either be melted into a magma ocean by
              radiogenic heating from Al26, if it formed early; or it would cool
              below solidus, if it formed relatively late. However, melt
              migration is also controlled by permeability, which could be high
              for aggregates of rock boulders (compared to those of mineral
              grains). Specifically, the theory of planet formation suggests
              that collisions occurred frequently between planetesimals in the
              early solar system. These collisions may have shattered the
              planetesimals into fragments with sizes of meters to tens of
              meters, which would have accreted gravitationally into one or more
              daughter bodies. We develop a model to investigate melt migration
              in “rubble-pile” planetesimals; in particular, the melt exchange
              between partially molten rock boulders and the void space between
              them. The results suggest that, with typical properties of
              primitive achondrite materials at the conditions of low-degree
              partial melting, melts may have been squeezed into the voids
              between boulders, and migrated rapidly through these channels.
              Therefore, primitive achondrites may record melt migration in
              rubble-pile bodies reaccreted from fragments of partially molten
              planetesimals.",

               manner in which the planet accreted. Small bodies (i.e.,
               planetesimals), if they accreted sufficiently early, may have
               melted and differentiated due to the decay of short-lived
               radioisotopes such as 26Al. For Earth-sized bodies, the final
               stages of accretion involved impacts between comparably sized
               objects, many of which were probably already differentiated.
               These impacts were sufficiently energetic to melt large portions
               of the planet, although the lateral extent of the melting and the
               lifetime of the resulting magma oceans are both currently poorly
               understood. Metal–silicate segregation, as required for core
               formation, can occur by several mechanisms depending on the
               degree of melting. The percolation of molten iron through solid
               silicates, which depends on the wetting properties of the melt
               (dihedral angle), melt fraction and shear stress, is unlikely to
               be an efficient mechanism in an Earth-sized planet. In a magma
               ocean, on the other hand, the separation of molten iron from
               molten silicates is very rapid and efficient. Core formation
               itself releases gravitational energy and thus generates further
               heating. Thus, once the Earth grew sufficiently large, melting
               and core formation were inevitable. Because of the stochastic
               nature of late-stage impacts, large bodies of iron (the cores of
               planetesimals) were delivered to the Earth at discrete intervals.
               The extent to which these iron bodies emulsified during impacts
               is currently uncertain but has important implications for the
               chemical evolution of the core and mantle. The hafnium–tungsten
               (Hf–W) chronometer has been used to constrain the core formation
               time of the Earth to 30–50 Myr after solar system formation. This
               timescale, though it cannot fully capture the growth of the core
               by multiple, discrete impacts, is in good agreement with
               numerical accretion models. The Hf–W results show that the cores
               of impactors at least partly reequilibrated with the silicate
               mantle, suggesting that emulsification during impacts is a
               relatively efficient process. Mantle siderophile element
               concentrations are higher than would be expected based on
               low-pressure partition coefficients. Metal–silicate partition
               coefficients determined at high P–T conditions (20–40GPa and
               2500–4000K) can explain the abundances of moderately siderophile
               elements. These partition coefficients are again consistent with
               metal–silicate equilibration occurring near the base of a magma
               ocean, though the true picture is likely to involve multiple
               magma oceans with different (and evolving) conditions of
               pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity. The highly
               siderophile element (HSE) concentrations require the addition of
               chondritic material to the mantle (the ‘late veneer’) after core
               formation ended. The identity of the light element(s) in the core
               is currently uncertain, due mainly to the paucity of experiments
               at the required P–T conditions. As for the siderophile elements,
               the light element content was likely set during core formation
               through metal–silicate partitioning. Based on cosmochemical
               arguments and a range of recent studies, the major light element
               in the core is most likely silicon, with a lesser amount of O and
               ~2wt\%S.",

              and core material from the target and impactor, respectively. In
              order to better constrain the collision, we present particle size
              distribution (PSD) analyses of olivines in seven main group
              pallasites and of the Eagle station pallasite. The PSDs of two

              segments in bi-logarithmic particle number versus size diagrams
              that are similar to terrestrial cataclasites or impact-related
              rocks. On the other hand, the PSDs of four angular pallasites only
              display linear segments above their respective average grain
              sizes. We argue that fragmental pallasites record brittle rock
              deformation close to the impact site of the collision, while
              angular pallasites represent deeper-lying mantle rocks of the

              metal melt percolation and concomitant mantle disintegration as

              boundaries caused by a small fraction of previously present metal
              melt in the mantle as opposed to localized diking that is dominant
              in a melt-free mantle. The former mechanism is expected to prevent
              efficient core-merging and instead causes mantle-impregnation with
              metal melt, which could be active when planetesimal mantles were
              still warm due to short-lived radiogenic heating. In addition to
              the parent body of the PMG, asteroid 16 Psyche may be an example

              quantification of the effects of variable amounts of silicate melt
              and molten metal on the connectivity of metal-rich liquids. To
              shed light on this question, the equilibrium geometry and textural
              ripening of metal grains in the vicinity of the metal
              interconnection threshold have been determined experimentally.
              High pressure and temperature experiments were performed in the
              three-phase system forsterite + silicate melt + nickel at
              conditions of 1 GPa and up to 2080 K using piston-cylinder and
              Paris-Edinburgh presses. Sample textures were analyzed by 3D X-Ray
              microtomography either in-situ at the PSICHE beamline of the
              SOLEIL synchrotron, or on quenched samples using a laboratory
              Computed Tomography scan. Although dihedral angles point to
              textural equilibrium at the scale of individual grains at the end
              of each experiment, the attainment of textural equilibrium at
              sample scale is not straightforward. Depending on the relative
              proportions of the phases, different states of textural maturation
              are revealed. A particularly important issue is that time-resolved
              in-situ microtomography data show that cold (subsolidus)
              compression at the beginning of the experiment leads to soft metal
              grains being squeezed between silicates, leading to a forced
              interconnectivity of nickel. High temperature experiments with
              metal contents ≤20 vol\% resulted in disruption of these forced
              networks, while the networks persisted in time for metal contents
              ≥25 vol\%. This is taken to indicate that the stable
              interconnection threshold of pure nickel in a partially molten
              silicate matrix lies between 20 and 25 vol\%. Therefore, we
              conclude that care must be taken when defining the interconnection
              threshold: not only should there be existence of a network of
              touching grains, but this network must persist in time in the
              absence of external forces and at pressure-temperature conditions
              that permit grain-boundary movement (i.e. excluding kinetically
              arrested systems). Growth of silicate grains is identified as the
              process driving textural maturation, and may explain the
              variability of interconnection thresholds reported in the
              literature. In addition, these considerations shed light on the
              diversity of textures observed in natural meteoritic samples (e.g.
              carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites and primitive achondrites),
              providing textural arguments to constrain the processes that

              timescales: rapid cooling at high temperatures (K/yrs) and slow

              shows contrasting textures ranging from well-rounded to angular
              and fragmental, and some samples record chemical zoning. Previous
              pallasite formation models have required fortuitous changes to the
              parent body in order to explain these contrasting timescales and
              textures, including late addition of a megaregolith layer, impact
              excavation, or parent body break-up and recombination. We
              investigate the timescales recorded in Main Group Pallasite
              meteorites with a coupled multiscale thermal diffusion modelling
              approach, using a 1D model of the parent body and a 3D model of
              the metal-olivine intrusion region, to see if these large-scale
              changes to the parent body are necessary. We test a range of
              intrusion volumes and aspect ratios, metal-to-olivine ratios, and
              initial temperatures for both the background mantle and the
              intruded metal. We find that the contrasting timescales, textural
              heterogeneity, and preservation of chemical zoning can all occur
              within one simple ellipsoidal segment of an intrusion complex.
              These conditions are satisfied in 13\% of our randomly generated
              models (2200 model runs), with small intrusion volumes (with a
              mean radius ≲100 m) and colder background mantle temperatures
              (≲1200 K) favourable. Large rounded olivine can be explained by a
              previous intrusion of metal into a hotter mantle, suggesting
              possible repeated bombardment of the parent body. We speculate
              that the formation of pallasitic zones within planetesimals may
              have been a common occurrence in the early Solar System, as our
              model shows that favourable pallasite conditions can be
              accommodated in a wide range of intrusion morphologies, across a
              wide range of planetesimal mantle temperatures, without the need
              for large-scale changes to the parent body. We suggest that
              pallasites represent a late stage of repeated injection of metal
              into a cooling planetesimal mantle, and that heterogeneity
              observed in micro-scale rounding or chemical zoning preservation
              in pallasite olivine can be explained by diverse cooling rates in
              different regions of a small intrusion.",

               intergrown metal-troilite textures are shown to form in response
               to three different impact-related processes. (1) During impacts,
               immiscible melt emulsions form in response to spatially focused
               heating. (2) Immediately after impact events, re-equilibration of
               heterogeneously distributed heat promotes metamorphism adjacent
               to zones of maximum impact heating. Where temperatures exceed
               ~850 °C, this post-impact metamorphism results in melting of
               conjoined metal-troilite grains in chondrites that were
               previously equilibrated through radiogenic metamorphism. When the
               resulting Fe-Ni-S melt domains crystallize, a finely intergrown
               mixture of troilite and metal forms, which can be zoned with
               kamacite-rich margins and taenite-rich cores. (3) At lower
               temperatures, post-impact metamorphism can also cause liberation
               of sulfur from troilite, which migrates into adjacent Fe-Ni
               metal, allowing formation of troilite and occasionally copper
               within the metal during cooling. Because impact events cause
               heating within a small volume, post-impact metamorphism is a
               short duration event (days to years) compared with radiogenic
               metamorphism (>10 6 years). The fast kinetics of metal-sulfide
               reactions allows widespread textural changes in conjoined
               metal-troilite grains during post-impact metamorphism, whereas
               the slow rate of silicate reactions causes these to be either
               unaffected or only partially annealed, except in the largest
               impact events. Utilizing this knowledge, information can be
               gleaned as to whether a given meteorite has suffered a
               post-impact thermal overprint, and some constraints can be placed
               on the temperatures reached and duration of heating.",

              in metamorphic temperatures from pristine primitive meteorites up
              to the temperatures required for extensive silicate partial
              melting. Here, we conduct a detailed analysis of Watson 012, an H7
              ordinary chondrite, to generate some clarity on the textural and
              chemical changes associated with equilibrium-based silicate
              partial melting in chondritic meteorites. To do this we compare
              the textures in the meteorite with those preserved in metamorphic
              contact aureoles on Earth. The most distinctive texture generated
              by the partial melting that affected Watson 012 is an extensively
              interconnected plagioclase network, which is clearly observable
              with a petrographic microscope. Enlarged metal–troilite grains are
              encapsulated at widenings in this plagioclase network, and this is
              clearly visible in reflected light. Together with these features,
              we define a series of other characteristics that can be used to
              more clearly classify chondritic meteorites as being of petrologic
              Type 7. To provide comprehensive evidence of silicate partial
              melting and strengthen the case for using simple petrographic
              observations to classify similar meteorites, we use
              high-resolution X-ray computed tomography to demonstrate that the
              plagioclase network has a high degree of interconnectedness and
              crystallised as large (cm-scale) skeletal crystals within an
              olivine–orthopyroxene–clinopyroxene framework, essentially
              pseudomorphing a melt network. Back-scattered electron imaging and
              element mapping are used to show that some of the clino- and
              orthopyroxene in Watson 012 also crystallised from silicate melt,
              and the order of crystallisation was
              orthopyroxene→clinopyroxene→plagioclase. X-ray diffraction data,
              supported by bulk geochemistry, are used to show that plagioclase
              and ortho- and clinopyroxene were added to the Watson 012 sample
              by through-flowing basaltic melt. Along with the absence of glass
              and granophyre, this interconnected network of coarse-grained
              skeletal plagioclase indicates that the sample cooled slowly at
              depth within the parent body. The evidence of melt flux indicates
              that Watson 012 formed in the presence of a gravitational
              gradient, and thus at significant distance from the centre of the
              H chondrite parent body (the gravitational gradient at the centre
              would be zero). Our interpretation is that incipient silicate
              partial melting in Watson 012 occurred when a region of
              radiogenically heated H6 material located at considerable depth
              (possibly at ∼15–20km from surface) was heated by an additional
              ca. 200–300°C in association with a large shock event. Due to
              insulation at depth within an already hot parent body, the
              post-shock temperature equilibrated and remained above the solidus
              long enough for widespread equilibrium-based silicate partial
              melting, and for melt to migrate. Although the observed melting
              may have been facilitated by additional heating from an impact
              event, this is not an example of instantaneous shock melting,
              which produces thermal disequilibrium at short length scales and
              distinctly different textures. A small number of H, L and LL
              chondrites have been previously classified as being of petrologic
              Type 7; with our new criteria to support that classification,
              these represent our best opportunity to explore the transition
              from high temperature sub-solidus metamorphism through the onset
              of silicate partial melting in three different parent bodies.",

               Fe,Ni-metal grains, and troilite (FeS). Conjoined metal-troilite
               grains would be the first phase to melt during radiogenic heating
               in the parent body, if temperatures reached over approximately
               910?960 °C (the Fe,Ni-FeS eutectic). On the basis of two-pyroxene
               thermometry of 13 ordinary chondrites, we argue that peak
               temperatures in some type 6 chondrites exceeded the Fe,Ni-FeS
               eutectic and thus conjoined metal-troilite grains would have
               begun to melt. Melting reactions consume energy, so thermal
               models were constructed to investigate the effect of melting on
               the thermal history of the H, L, and LL parent asteroids. We
               constrained the models by finding the proportions of conjoined
               metal-troilite grains in ordinary chondrites using
               high-resolution X-ray computed tomography. The models show that
               metal-troilite melting causes thermal buffering and inhibits the
               onset of silicate melting. Compared with models that ignore the
               effect of melting, our models predict longer cooling histories
               for the asteroids and accretion times that are earlier by 61,
               124, or 113 kyr for the H, L, and LL asteroids, respectively.
               Because the Ni/Fe ratio of the metal and the bulk troilite/metal
               ratio is higher in L and LL chondrites than H chondrites, thermal
               buffering has the greatest effect in models for the L and LL
               chondrite parent bodies, and least effect for the H chondrite
               parent. Metal-troilite melting is also relevant to models of
               primitive achondrite parent bodies, particularly those that
               underwent only low degrees of silicate partial melting. Thermal
               models can predict proportions of petrologic types formed within
               an asteroid, but are systematically different from the statistics
               of meteorite collections. A sampling bias is interpreted to
               explain these differences.",

              models showed partial melting of iron (a phase difficult to melt
              in shock heating) due to the eutectic properties of the mixtures.
              Iron melting only occurred in models presenting either strong

                   our own Solar System, has been revised to account for the
                   observed diversity of the exoplanetary systems. At the same

                   the new information derived from the exoplanets population
                   and the circumstellar disks observations. We present the new
                   developments in planet formation theory, from dust evolution
                   to the growth of planetary cores by accretion of
                   planetesimals, pebbles, and gas. We review the
                   state-of-the-art models for the formation of diverse
                   planetary systems, including the population synthesis
                   approach which is necessary to compare theoretical model
                   outcomes to the exoplanet population. We emphasize that the
                   planet formation process may not be spatially uniform in the
                   disk and there are preferential locations for the formation
                   of planetesimals and planets. Outside of these locations, a
                   significant fraction of solids is not growing past the

                   role in the growth of planetary cores in the pebble accretion
                   process. The timescale of the emergence of massive planetary
                   cores is an important aspect of the present models and it is
                   likely that the cores within one disk form at different
                   times. In addition, there is growing evidence that the first

              one magmatic intrusion is a channel of ore-bearing fluids, but not
              their source. Therefore, it is possible to use TMF’s ability for
              injection into and for escaping from the magmatic intrusion to
              evaluate its ore-forming potential. As the ore-bearing fluids
              cannot effectively inject into the magmatic intrusion when the
              magma fully crystallized, the cooling time and rates viscosity
              varied can be used to estimate the minimum critical thickness of
              the intrusion. One dimensional heat transfer model is used to
              determine the cooling time for three representative dikes of
              different composition (granite porphyry, quartz diorite and
              diabase) in the Shihu gold deposit. It also estimated the rates
              viscosity varied in these time interval. We took the thickness of
              dike at the intersection of the cooling time – thickness curve and
              the rates viscosity varied versus thickness curve as the minimum
              critical thickness. For the ore-bearing fluids effectively
              injecting into the magma, the minimum critical thicknesses for the
              three representative dikes are 33.45 m for granite porphyry, 8.22
              m for quartz diorite and 1.02 m for diabase, indicating that
              ore-bearing dikes must be thicker than each value. These results
              are consistent with the occurrence of ore bodies, and thus they
              could be applied in practice. Based on the statistical
              relationship between the length and the width of dikes, these
              critical thicknesses are used to compute critical areas:
              0.0003–0.0016 km2 for diabase, 0.014–0.068 km2 for quartz diorite
              and 0.011–0.034 km2 for granite porphyry. This implies that
              ore-bearing minor intrusions have varied areas corresponding to
              their composition. The numerical simulation has provided the
              theoretical threshold of exposed thickness and area of the

               lower temperature, mineralized, and inclusion-rich quartz diorite
               (MIQD). The MIQD facies was emplaced after QD dykes had
               solidified. Key controlling factors of the two injection phases
               were (1) the development of a coherent roof, which confined the
               melt sheet; and (2) the periodic increase of melt and fluid
               pressure within the melt sheet. For the injection of QD melt, the
               melt pressure exceeded the normal stress acting on fracture
               surfaces. For the later refracturing of QD dykes and the
               injection of MIQD melt, the melt pressure increased further,
               exceeding the tensile strength of, and the normal stress acting
               on, QD dykes. We associate the melt pressure increase required
               for both injection episodes with degassing and devolatilization
               of cooling melt close to the roof. Within the hydraulically
               connected melt column, the related pressure increase was
               transmitted to the base of the melt sheet where QD and MIQD melt

              pure inclusion-free massive sulfide ores; (2) sulfide matrix ore
              breccias, of sharp-wall, soft-wall or mixed character; (3)
              emulsion textured ores formed by frozen mixtures of molten
              silicate and sulfide, most commonly developed as melt films at
              thermal erosion contacts; (4) vein-hosted sulfides formed at late
              magmatic or high temperature post-emplacement deformation stage
              close to the brittle-ductile transition in the country rocks or
              host igneous bodies; and (5) tectonic “durchbewegung” breccias,
              formed by mechanical inter-shearing of less-ductile silicate
              inclusions and more-ductile solid sulfides. Some deposits, the
              Moran Shoot at Kambalda being the type example, record the
              invasion of country rock footwall by downward- or
              sideways-percolating superheated molten sulfide liquid generating
              vertical sequences of pure massive sulfide, emulsion textured ores
              and finely-spaced invasive sulfide veins; these are referred to as
              sulfide melting-infiltration fronts and may provide a clue to the
              mechanism of formation of sulfide-rich magmatic ores as whole.
              Sulfide matrix ore breccias are particularly well developed in the
              Voisey’s Bay and Aguablanca deposits, where they developed by
              flooding of percolating sulfide melt through the silicate matrix
              of magmatic intrusion breccias, displacing silicate melt. The
              lithology of the silicate or carbonate rock inclusions determines
              the nature of the inclusion-matrix relationships. Non-refractory
              inclusions typically disaggregate along original grain boundaries
              to leave coherent inclusions surrounded by clouds of
              inclusion-derived or matrix-derived crystals, with the low-melting
              silicate component preferentially displaced by sulfide liquid,
              whereas refractory inclusions retain sharp boundaries. Zonation of
              inclusions and overgrowths preserves reaction between inclusion
              and silicate matrix that pre-dates invasion of the intrusion
              breccia by sulfide liquid. The process of percolation of dense,
              low-viscosity sulfide liquid into pore space and fractures within
              partially molten (or melting) silicate rock is a unifying theme
              that links sulfide matrix ore breccias and emulsion textured ores
              with distinctive textures in less sulfide rich rocks such as
              net-texture (matrix ore texture), leopard texture (poikilitic net
              texture) and interspinifex ore. Vein-hosted massive sulfides may
              be emplaced under magmatic conditions where the excess pressure of
              the sulfide liquid column drives or enhances fracturing of the
              country rock and injection of sulfide into the cracks. Such veins
              are commonly referred to as “remobilised”, a term which may
              obscure process understanding and should be reserved for cases
              where tectonic solid-state mobilisation of sulfide can be
              demonstrated on textural and structural grounds. The tendency of
              sulfide liquids to invade country rocks and potentially to drive
              the propagation of their own magmatic containers may be a critical
              feedback loop in the development of magmatic sulfide mineral
              systems.",

               critical, but underappreciated, role in delivering meteorites to
               Earth. Two variants of the effect cause drifts in orbital
               elements, notably semimajor axes. The “classic” or “diurnal”
               Yarkovsky effect is associated with diurnal rotation at low
               obliquity. More recently, a “seasonal” effect has also been
               described, associated with high obliquity. Studies of these
               Yarkovsky effects are combined with studies of resonance effects
               to clarify meteorite delivery. If there were no Yarkovsky drift,
               asteroid fragments could reach a resonance only if produced very
               near that resonance. However, objects in resonances typically
               reach Earth-crossing orbits within a few million years, which is
               inconsistent with stone meteorites' cosmic-ray exposure (CRE)
               ages (5–50 Ma) and iron meteorites' CRE ages (100–1000 Ma). In
               the new view, on the other hand, large objects in the asteroid
               belt are “fixed” in semimajor axis, but bodies up to 100 m in
               diameter are in a constant state of mixing and flow, especially
               if the thermal conductivity of their surface layers is low. Thus,
               small asteroid fragments may reach the resonances after long
               periods of drift in the main belt. Yarkovsky drift effects,
               combined with resonance effects, appear to explain many meteorite
               properties, including: (1) the long CRE ages of iron meteorites
               (due to extensive drift lifetimes in the belt); (2) iron
               meteorites' sampling of numerous parent bodies; (3) the shorter
               CRE ages of most stone meteorites (due to faster drift, coupled
               with weaker strength and more rapid collisional erosion); and (4)
               the abundance of falls from discrete impact events near
               resonances, such as the 8 Ma CRE age of H chondrites. Other
               consequences include: the delivery of meteorite parent bodies to
               resonances is enhanced; proportions of stone and iron meteorites
               delivered to Earth may be different from the proportions at the
               same sizes left in the belt, which in turn may differ from the
               ratio produced in asteroidal collisions; Rabinowitz's 10–100 m
               objects may be preferentially delivered to near-Earth space; and
               the delivery of C-class fragments from the outer belt may be
               inhibited, compared to classes in other parts of the belt. Thus,
               Yarkovsky effects may have important consequences in meteoritics
               and asteroid science.",

               ductility single-phase ferritic steel during uniaxial deformation
               is explored using three-dimensional X-ray diffraction. Grains
               well aligned for dislocation slip are shown to possess a wide
               intergranular stress range, controlled by per-grain dependent
               hardening activity. Contrariwise, grains orientated poorly for
               slip have a narrow stress range. A grain neighbourhood effect is
               observed of statistical significance: the Schmid factor of serial
               adjoining grains influences the stress state of a grain of
               interest, whereas parallel neighbours are less influential. This
               phenomenon is strongest at low plastic strains, with the effect
               diminishing as grains rotate during plasticity to eliminate any
               orientation dependent load shedding. The ability of the ferrite
               to eliminate such neighbourhood interactions is considered key to
               the high ductility possessed by these materials. The response of
               a polycrystalline material during loading is strongly dependent
               on grain-level effects, such as residual stress from plasticity
               and grain orientation. Here, in-situ three-dimensional X-ray

              up to large strains, we performed axial extension experiments at
              1200 °C, 300 MPa confining pressure, and constant displacement
              rate leading to strain rates ~10−5 s−1 on three natural
              peridotites: a fine-grained mylonitic harzburgite with a weak
              olivine CPO and two coarse-grained well-equilibrated dunites with
              olivine CPO of variable intensity. Despite the contrasting initial
              microstructures, initial flow stresses show a limited range of
              variation (115–165 ± 5 MPa), with the fine-grained harzburgite
              displaying the highest initial strength. However, the evolution of
              both mechanical behavior and microstructure differs markedly
              between fine and coarse-grained peridotites. In the fine-grained
              harzburgite, necking is associated with decrease in the apparent
              differential stress. Focusing of strain and stress resulted in
              increase of the olivine CPO intensity and recrystallized fraction
              and decrease of the recrystallized grain size in the neck.
              Analysis of the final stress and strain in the neck indicates
              softening in response to the evolution of the microstructure and
              CPO. In contrast, necking of the coarse-grained dunite samples is
              associated with either a weaker or no decrease in the apparent
              differential stress. This implies hardening, consistently with (1)
              the increase in bulk intragranular misorientation with increasing
              strain observed in these samples and (2) final stresses in the
              neck similar or higher than the initial ones. All coarse-grained
              dunites displayed a highly heterogeneous deformation. Crystals
              well oriented to deform by dislocation glide became elongated and
              developed marked undulose extinction, whereas crystals in hard
              orientations remained almost undeformed. In the neck, stress and
              strain concentration (local stresses and strains attained up to
              365 ± 15 MPa and 240\%, respectively) resulted in formation of

              more effective strain-induced softening of the fine-grained
              peridotite as due to easier dynamic recrystallization, probably
              due to the higher proportion of grain boundaries acting as

              evidence of a gradual transition from nodular to massive
              varieties. Nodular types are least affected by deformation.
              Deformation structures, restricted mainly in massive types include
              intracrystalline features of brittle as well as crystal plastic
              processes within chromite. Brittle deformation is preserved as
              grain fracturing and intense microbrecciation along narrow zones
              forming protocataclasite. Crystal plastic deformation has
              generated chromite subgrains and new grains in response to
              recovery and recrystallization processes. Subgrains are polygonal
              in shape and the boundaries between them are commonly straight

              are commonly internally zoned and the mosaics formed by them

              at their cores and high Fe at their boundaries in response to

              likely to have started with crystal plastic processes and later
              switched over to the brittle regime. The preservation of all
              grain-scale deformation structures in the chromitite bodies of the

              (x=0.14) to 14GPa. Aggregate bulk and shear moduli of hydrous
              forsterite increase with pressure at a greater rate than those of
              the corresponding anhydrous phase. Compared with anhydrous
              forsterite, we observe a 7\% increase in the pressure derivative
              of the bulk modulus (KS0′=4.50(5)), and a 25\% increase in the
              pressure derivative of the shear modulus (G0′=1.75(5)) for
              forsterite with near maximum possible water content. Using our

              Whereas VP and VS of hydrous forsterite are 0.6\% and 0.4\% slower
              than those of anhydrous forsterite at ambient pressure, velocity
              crossovers at ∼3–4GPa result in higher hydrous forsterite

              the pressure of the 410-km discontinuity, VP and VS of hydrous
              forsterite exceed those of anhydrous forsterite by 1.1(1)\% and

              to 3.8(4)\% and4.8(6)\%, respectively. At high pressures,
              hydration also decreases the VP/VS ratio of forsterite, and lowers

              finite element method to perform comprehensive micromechanical
              analyses and determine the effective thermoelastic properties of
              polycrystalline materials. Smooth grain boundaries are generated
              from the discretely sampled electron backscatter diffraction data
              of real polycrystalline materials. The microscale displacements,
              strains and stresses are related to the macroscale temperature
              change and strains through 21 distinct characteristic functions.
              The three-dimensional equilibrium equations at the microscale
              yield a system of partial differential equations for the
              characteristic functions which are solved using the finite element
              method. The effective properties of the polycrystalline material
              are obtained from the single-crystal thermoelastic properties,
              crystallographic orientations of the crystallites and the
              characteristic functions. The proposed methodology is demonstrated
              by considering electron backscatter diffraction maps of zinc,
              stainless steel, and natural quartzite rock. Results are presented
              for homogenized properties such as elastic stiffnesses, thermal

               obtained by inverting ground motions and using the results to
               model slip on the fault surface. However, this practice cannot

               processes, so our understanding of the importance of these
               processes comes largely from field‐ and laboratory‐based studies.
               Here, we use garnet fragment size data to estimate surface‐area
               energy density with distance from the fault core in the damage
               zone of a deeply exhumed strike‐slip fault/shear zone. Estimated
               energy densities per fragmentation event range from 2.87 × 103 to
               2.72 × 105 J/m3 in the outer and inner portions of the dynamic

              in containing variable amounts of silicates, ranging from minor to
              stony-iron proportions (∼50\%). These irons provide important
              constraints on the evolution of planetesimals and asteroids,
              especially with regard to the nature of metal–silicate separation
              and mixing. I present a review and synthesis of available data,
              including a compilation and interpretation of host metal
              trace-element compositions, oxygen-isotope compositions, textures,
              mineralogy, phase chemistries, and bulk compositions of silicate
              portions, ages of silicate and metal portions, and thermal
              histories. Case studies for the petrogeneses of igneous silicate
              lithologies from different groups are provided. Silicate-bearing
              irons were formed on multiple parent bodies under different
              conditions. The IAB/IIICD irons have silicates that are mainly
              chondritic in composition, but include some igneous lithologies,
              and were derived from a volatile-rich asteroid that underwent
              small amounts of silicate partial melting but larger amounts of
              metallic melting. A large proportion of IIE irons contain
              fractionated alkali-silica-rich inclusions formed as partial melts
              of chondrite, although other IIE irons have silicates of
              chondritic composition. The IIEs were derived from an
              H-chondrite-like asteroid that experienced more significant
              melting than the IAB asteroid. The two stony-iron IVAs were
              derived from an extensively melted and apparently chemically
              processed L or LL-like asteroid that also produced a metallic
              core. Ungrouped silicate-bearing irons were derived from seven
              additional asteroids. Hf–W age data imply that metal–silicate
              separation occurred within 0–10Ma of CAI formation for these
              irons, suggesting internal heating by 26Al. Chronometers were
              partly re-set at later times, mainly earlier for the IABs and
              later for the IIEs, including one late (3.60±0.15Ga) strong impact
              that affected the “young silicate” IIEs Watson (unfractionated
              silicate, and probable impact melt), Netschaëvo (unfractionated,
              and metamorphosed), and Kodaikanal (fractionated). Kodaikanal
              probably did not undergo differentiation in this late impact, but
              the similar ages of the “young silicate” IIEs imply that
              relatively undifferentiated and differentiated materials
              co-existed on the same asteroid. The thermal histories and
              petrogeneses of fractionated IIE irons and IVA stony irons are
              best accommodated by a model of disruption and reassembly of
              partly molten asteroids.",

                  principle and its later versions are frequently quoted in
                  discussions about anomalies, it will be discussed here in some
                  detail. After a short look at the historic roots, the
                  principal modern formulations are summarized. It will be shown
                  that a demand for ``simplicity'' cannot be generally
                  sustained. Rather, striving for simplicity can conflict with
                  other essentials of scientific method. Ockham's principle - no
                  matter whether in its original or in a modified version -
                  cannot help toward a rational decision between competing

                  Ockham's Razor only leads to a perpetuation and corroboration

              present or in the past, although a high surface temperature and
              recent resurfacing events may have removed paleomagnetic evidence.
              Whether or not a terrestrial body can sustain an internally
              generated magnetic field by convection inside its metallic fluid
              core is determined in part by its initial thermodynamic state and
              its compositional structure, both of which are in turn set by the
              processes of accretion and differentiation. Here we show that the
              cores of Earth- and Venus-like planets should grow with stable
              compositional stratification unless disturbed by late energetic
              impacts. They do so because higher abundances of light elements
              are incorporated into the liquid metal that sinks to form the core
              as the temperatures and pressures of metal-silicate equilibration
              increase during accretion. We model this process and determine
              that this establishes a stable stratification that resists
              convection and inhibits the onset of a geodynamo. However, if a
              late energetic impact occurs, it could mechanically stir the core
              creating a single homogenous region within which a long-lasting
              geodynamo would operate. While Earth's accretion has been
              punctuated by a late giant impact with likely enough energy to mix
              the core (e.g. the impact that formed the Moon), we hypothesize
              that the accretion of Venus is characterized by the absence of
              such energetic giant impacts and the preservation of its
              primordial stratifications.",

               (0.2–1 billion years). Venus’s geophysical models have sought to
               explain these observations by invoking either stagnant lid
               tectonics and protracted volcanic resurfacing, or by a late
               episode of catastrophic mantle overturn. These scenarios,
               however, are sensitive to poorly understood internal initial
               conditions and rheological properties, and their ability to
               explain Venus’s young surface age remains unclear. Here we show
               that long-lived volcanism, driven by early, energetic collisions
               on Venus, offers an explanation of its young surface age with
               stagnant lid tectonics. This volcanic activity is fuelled by a
               superheated core, resulting in vigorous internal melting

               in some meteorites, although previous work has demonstrated that
               such events could not be responsible for the global thermal
               evolution of a meteorite parent body. At this early epoch in
               solar system history, however, meteorite parent bodies would have
               been heated or retained heat from the decay of short-lived
               radionuclides, most notably 26 Al. The postimpact structure of an
               impacted body is shown here to be a strong function of the
               internal temperature structure of the target body. We calculate
               the temperature-time history of all mass in these impacted
               bodies, accounting for their heating in an onion-shell-structured
               body prior to the collision event and then allowing for the

              that enables the analysis of failure, even when the evolution and
              propagation of cohesive micro-cracks induce material instability,
              is proposed. The development of this
              macro-continuous/micro-discontinuous formulation is based on the
              Method of Multi-Scale Virtual Power, from which dynamic
              equilibrium and homogenisation equations are derived, ensuring a
              variationally consistent scale transition. The respective minimal
              kinematical constraint is retrieved and enforced with the Lagrange
              multiplier method. The formulation is also extended for periodic
              boundary conditions. The discretisation of the resulting
              equilibrium equations, with the finite element method and the
              generalised-α method, is described in detail. Second, a
              fracture-based computational homogenisation procedure is developed
              to obtain homogenised traction-separation laws and fracture
              properties from microstructural volume elements. It is derived
              from a crack-based Hill-Mandel principle and employs a novel
              energetic-based damage variable, within the Park-Paulino-Roesler
              cohesive model, proposed to define the crack domain and compute
              the crack homogenised quantities. A strategy for accurately
              computing the homogenised unit normal vector of the equivalent

              boundary conditions. This work also reveals the convergence of the
              traction-separation law with increasing microstructure model size
              when using the fracture-based computational homogenisation.

              of the singular stress field. This widely used theory applies for
              cracks that are planar, but cracks typically are not planar, and

              correlation (HRDIC) to measure plastic strain at the sub-micron
              scale on the surface of a nickel superalloy strained to 2\%. The
              strain values have been correlated to different misorientation
              measures at the grain and subgrain scale, over several hundreds of
              grains. We show that although the grain mean plastic strain is
              positively correlated to the lattice misorientation, there is a
              large scatter in the correlation, which depends on the
              misorientation measure used. There is also essentially no
              correlation between the magnitude of grain strain and grain
              orientation derived parameters like the Schmid factor and the
              Taylor factor, largely due to deformation bands at the mesoscale
              that are not crystallographic. At these strain levels, the
              relationship between misorientation and plastic strain is affected
              by the differences in how slip (discontinuous) and lattice
              rotation (continuous) develop, by local grain interactions and the
              development of transgranular strain localisation. It is therefore
              effectively not possible to quantify plastic strain within
              individual grains using EBSD derived misorientation values alone,
              although some measures of misorientation are more appropriate than
              others if there is an understanding of the underlying local
              plastic phenomena. Whereas slip is localised in slip bands, the
              misorientation varies smoothly in a manner that is only weakly
              spatially correlated to the slip. These findings have implications

              infer mechanical and structural information on the cratering

              behavior must be understood. Here, we use numerical simulations to
              demonstrate how stresses act during shock metamorphism across all
              regions of the target that experience solid-state shock
              metamorphism. Furthermore, our numerical simulations predict the
              strains that are produced as a consequence of those stresses. The
              results show that the magnitude and orientation of stress and
              strain during shock metamorphism are variable throughout the

              the individual “cells” of the segmented olivine, and, by
              bridgmanite formation. Subsequently, spherulitic
              magnesiowüstite+bridgmanite assemblages occur around residual
              olivine domain, and finally, olivine completely dissociates to
              equigranular magnesiowüstite+bridgmanite assemblage. Olivine
              grains adjacent to the melt-pockets transform to randomly oriented
              polycrystalline ringwoodite assemblages. In rare case, ahrensite
              occurs in the more iron-rich portions of the olivine grains. With
              increasing distance from the melt-pockets, sets of ringwoodite
              lamellae occur in increasing abundance into the interior of the
              olivine grains. The lamellae consist of almost
              crystallographically oriented polycrystalline ringwoodite
              assemblages. The phase transitions from olivine to ringwoodite
              were presumably promoted by interface-controlled incoherent
              mechanism. The ringwoodite would be metastable phase which formed
              in the stability field where olivine dissociates into
              magnesiowüstite+bridgmanite.",

              concentric intergrowth with Mg-rich wadsleyite of a very narrow

              that the MTZ has distinct rheological properties, but their exact
              cause is still unclear due to the lack of natural samples. Here we
              present the first direct evidence for crystal-plastic deformation
              by dislocation creep in the MTZ using a chromitite from the
              Luobusa peridotite (E. Tibet). Chromite grains show exsolution of
              diopside and SiO2, suggesting previous equilibration in the MTZ.
              Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis reveals that
              olivine grains co-existing with exsolved phases inside chromite
              grains and occurring on chromite grain boundaries have a single
              pronounced crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). This
              suggests that olivine preserves the CPO of a high-pressure
              polymorph (wadsleyite) before the high-pressure polymorph of
              chromite began to invert and exsolve. Chromite also shows a
              significant CPO. Thus, the fine-grained high-pressure phases were
              deformed by dislocation creep in the MTZ. Grain growth in inverted
              chromite produced an equilibrated microstructure during exhumation
              to the surface, masking at first sight its MTZ deformation
              history. These unique observations provide a window into the deep

  abstract = "We have studied the phase transformation of forsterite to
              wadsleyite under shear stress at the Earth's transition zone
              pressure and temperature conditions. Two-step experiments were
              performed using a multi-anvil press. First, we hot pressed
              iron-free forsterite at 6 or 11GPa and 1100°C. Then we deformed a
              slab of this starting material using a direct simple shear
              assembly at 16GPa and 1400°C for 1, 15, 35, 40, or 60min. Both the
              starting material and the deformed samples were characterized
              using optical and scanning electron microscopy including
              measurements of crystal preferred orientations (CPO) by electron
              back scattered diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron
              microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
              (FTIR). The phase transformation occurs very rapidly, in less than
              1min, and metastable forsterite relics are not observed after
              deformation. The grain size of wadsleyite is slightly smaller than
              the forsterite starting material. The water contents obtained from
              FTIR analyses in forsterite and wadsleyite are 65–124wtppm H2O and
              114–736wtppm H2O, respectively, which are well below water
              solubility at similar conditions in the presence of free water.
              Wadsleyite aggregates display weak CPO patterns with [100] axes
              concentrated at low angle to the shear direction, [010] axes
              perpendicular to the shear plane and nearly random [001] axes.
              Only a few dislocations were observed in wadsleyite with TEM. This
              observation is consistent with the assumption that most
              dislocations formed during the initial high-stress stages of these
              stress-relaxation experiments, were consumed in the phase
              transformation, probably enhancing the transformation rate. CPO
              patterns vary as a function of the water content: with increasing
              water content the density of [100] axes parallel to the shear
              direction decreases, and the density of [001] axes increases.
              Viscoplastic self-consistent modeling of CPO evolution using
              previously reported glide systems for wadsleyite, i.e., [100]{0kl}
              and 1/2 〈111〉{101}, cannot reproduce the measured CPO, unless the
              [001](010) system, for which dislocations have not been observed
              by TEM, is also activated. In addition, wadsleyite grain growth
              suggests the participation of diffusion-assisted processes in
              deformation. Calculated anisotropies for P and S-waves using
              measured CPO are always below 1\%. This very low anisotropy is due
              to both the low finite strain achieved in the experiments, which
              leads to weak wadsleyite CPO, and to the diluting effect of added
              majorite. The present experiments emphasize the importance of
              stress, grain size evolution and water content in the forsterite
              to wadsleyite phase transformation and subsequent deformation in
              the transition zone.",

              xenocrystic olivine from kimberlite deposits at the Diavik Diamond
              Mine, Canada and at Igwisi Hills volcano, Tanzania. We establish a
              relative sequence of textural events recorded by olivine during
              magma ascent through the cratonic mantle lithosphere, including:
              xenolith disaggregation, decompression fracturing expressed as
              mineral- and fluid-inclusion-rich sealed and healed cracks, grain
              size and shape modification by chemical dissolution and abrasion,
              late-stage crystallization of overgrowths on olivine xenocrysts,
              and lastly, mechanical milling and rounding of the olivine cargo
              prior to emplacement. Ascent through the lithosphere operates as a
              “kimberlite factory” wherein progressive upward dyke propagation
              of the initial carbonatitic melt fractures the overlying mantle to
              entrain and disaggregate mantle xenoliths. Preferential
              assimilation of orthopyroxene (Opx) xenocrysts by the
              silica-undersaturated carbonatitic melt leads to deep-seated
              exsolution of CO2-rich fluid generating buoyancy and supporting
              rapid ascent. Concomitant dissolution of olivine produces
              irregular-shaped relict grains preserved as cores to most
              kimberlitic olivine. Multiple generations of decompression cracks
              in olivine provide evidence for a progression in ambient fluid
              compositions (e.g., from carbonatitic to silicic) during ascent.
              Numerical modelling predicts tensile failure of xenoliths
              (disaggregation) and olivine (cracks) over ascent distances of 2–7
              km and 15–25 km, respectively, at velocities of 0.1 to >4 m s−1.
              Efficient assimilation of Opx during ascent results in a
              silica-enriched, olivine-saturated kimberlitic melt (i.e. SiO2 >20
              wt.\%) that crystallizes overgrowths on partially digested and
              abraded olivine xenocrysts. Olivine saturation is constrained to
              occur at pressures <1 GPa; an absence of decompression cracks

               between the α (olivine), ? (spinelloid) and ? (spinel) polymorphs
               of this system. the very high pressures of these transformations,
               however, has severely limited direct experimentation, hence
               several compounds that exhibit analogous transformations have
               been studied in order to infer the behavior of the mantle system.
               Such use of analogue materials can be a powerful approach but it
               carries with it the possibility of serious error because none of
               the systems available are completely analogous. Here, we use the
               microstructures exhibited by specimens of Mg2GeO4 to demonstrate
               how very faithfully this compound proxies for important
               nonhydrostatic stress effects in Mg-rich silicate olivine. In
               particular, both systems exhibit (i) martensitic and incoherent

               equiaxed forsterite grains +diopside (5 and 20 vol \%) were
               deformed with a grid etched onto the lateral surface. In Part 1
               of this study, we identified grain boundary sliding (GBS) and
               rigid body‐like grain rotation during deformation by diffusion
               creep where samples with tabular forsterite grains were shown to
               develop low‐index plane grain boundaries that result in
               crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Here we examine how
               grain rotation depends on the sample strain, grain size, phases,
               grain shapes, and orientations relative to the compression axis
               and long axes of tabular forsterite grains. Based on these
               results, we model grain rotation due to GBS that occurs
               preferentially along low‐index plane boundaries. The model
               reproduces all of the characteristics of grain rotation and
               together with the observed grain rotation rates in tabular and
               equiaxed grain samples, we estimate that low‐index plane
               boundaries have a lower viscosity by a factor of ~3 relative to
               general grain boundaries, which results in the development of CPO
               during diffusion creep. The observed constant rotation rate of
               ~0.4 (radian/strain) in equiaxed‐grain samples and in
               tabular‐grain samples deformed to a strain of >0.5 is considered
               to be a minimum and further, a material‐independent rotation rate
               during diffusion creep, indicating grain rotation as a primary
               microprocess during diffusion creep. We discuss the possible
               consequences of GBS‐induced grain rotation and CPO development in

               mixtures have been studied at temperatures of 1390 °C and 1340
               °C, at an oxygen fugacity (fO2) three orders of magnitude below
               the Ni–NiO buffer, for durations between 2 h and 10 days.
               Microstructures and grain size distributions show that grain
               growth is normal and that for durations >10 h the Zener relation
               is verified (i.e., the ratio of Fo and Ni grain size is
               independent of time). Comparison with results previously obtained
               at 1440 °C shows a similar grain growth exponent (n∼5) for both
               phases, consistent with growth of forsterite by grain boundary
               migration, limited by the growth-rate of nickel. The details of
               size distribution frequencies and the value of grain-growth
               exponent indicate that the nickel grains, which pin forsterite
               grain boundaries, grow by diffusion along one-dimensional paths
               (i.e., along forsterite triple junctions). The derived activation
               energies for nickel and forsterite are 235±33 kJ/mol and 400±48
               kJ/mol respectively. Within the framework of the Zener relation,
               this unexpected difference of activation energy is shown to be
               related to temperature-dependent variations in the ratio of Ni
               and Fo grain-size that are consistent with observed variations in
               Fo–Ni–Fo dihedral angle. These data thus indicate that the
               presence of all phases should be taken into account when
               considering the activation energy of growth rate of individual
               phases. As an application, the experimentally derived growth law
               for metal has been used in conjunction with temperature–time
               paths taken from models of the thermal history of the H-chondrite
               parent body to estimate the grain size evolution of metal in
               H-chondrites. A remarkably self-consistent picture emerges from
               experimentally derived grain-growth laws, textural data of metal
               grains in well characterised H-chondrite samples, and
               geochemically constrained temperature–time paths, providing the

               displacement and stress boundary integral equations of solid
               mechanics and it has the advantage of expressing the
               polycrystalline problem in terms of grain boundary variables
               only. The individual grains within the polycrystalline morphology
               are modelled as generally anisotropic linear elastic domains with
               random spatial orientation. Transgranular micro-cracking is
               assumed to occur along specific cleavage planes, whose
               orientation in space within the grains depend upon the
               crystallographic lattice. Both intergranular and transgranular
               micro-cracking are modelled using suitably defined cohesive laws,
               whose parameters characterise the behaviour of the two
               mechanisms. The algorithm developed to track the
               inter/transgranular micro-cracking history is presented and
               discussed. Several numerical tests involving pseudo-3D and fully
               3D morphologies are performed and analysed. The presented
               numerical results show that the developed formulation is capable
               of tracking the initiation and evolution of both intergranular
               and transgranular cracking as well as their competition, thus
               providing a useful tool for the study of damage micro-mechanics.",

               this. In CS classrooms, pair programming has been shown to
               significantly help women and men understand and appreciate
               programming concepts, and to help close gender gaps.
               Unfortunately, pair programming is not well supported in online

               Our overall objective is to address this gap by investigating the
               following question: How can we bring the educational benefits of
               pair programming to online CS students in gender-equitable ways?
               In this paper, we empirically investigate whether and how

               students of same- and mixed-gender pairs. Based on our results,

               results regarding the effectiveness of live-coding to teach
               introductory programming. The research design includes two
               experimental groups spread across four sections of an
               introductory C++ course at Colorado School of Mines. In the
               control group, students were taught using static code, meaning
               that instructors never typed, but instead viewed, compiled, and
               executed code examples. In the experimental or ``live-coding''
               group, instructors started each lecture with a blank screen, and
               taught code examples by systematically typing, compiling, and
               testing code to solve example problems. To assess the
               effectiveness of live-coding, we administered four surveys and
               analyzed final grades. Two of the surveys were given at the
               beginning of the course, and were used to measure baseline
               programming knowledge and student learning preferences (i.e.,
               VARK). The other two surveys, given at the end of the course,
               were designed to measure the amount of programming knowledge
               obtained as well as preferences towards live coding. Lastly,
               final grades were analyzed in terms of its subcomponents: the
               assignments, exams, final project, and overall grade. Based on
               our results, we conclude that teaching via live-coding is as good

  abstract  = "Abstract Context Women have historically been underrepresented in
               Software Engineering, due in part to the stereotyped assumption
               that women are less technically competent than men. Pair
               programming is both widely used in industry and has been shown to
               increase student interest in Software Engineering, particularly
               among women; but if those same gender biases are also present in
               pair programming, its potential for attracting women to the field
               could be thwarted. Objective We aim to explore the effects of
               gender bias in pair programming. Specifically, in a remote
               setting in which students cannot directly observe the gender of
               their peers, we study whether the perception of the partner, the
               behavior during programming, or the style of communication of
               Software Engineering students differ depending on the perceived
               gender of their remote partner. To our knowledge, this is the
               first study specifically focusing on the impact of gender
               stereotypes and bias within pairs in pair programming. Method We
               have developed an online pair-programming platform () that
               provides a collaborative editing window and a chat pane, both of
               which are heavily instrumented. Students in the control group had
               no information about their partner’s gender, whereas students in
               the treatment group could see a gendered avatar representing the
               other participant as a man or as a woman. The gender of the
               avatar was swapped between programming tasks to analyze 45
               variables related to the collaborative coding behavior, chat
               utterances, and questionnaire responses of 46 pairs in the
               original study at the University of Seville, and 23 pairs in the
               external replication at the University of California, Berkeley.
               Results We did not observe any statistically significant effect
               of the gender bias treatment, nor any interaction between the
               perceived partner’s gender and subject’s gender, in any of the 45
               response variables measured in the original study. In the
               external replication, we observed statistically significant
               effects with moderate to large sizes in four dependent variables
               within the experimental group, comparing how subjects acted when
               their partners were represented as a man or a woman. Conclusions
               The results in the original study do not show any clear effect of
               the treatment in remote pair programming among current Software
               Engineering students. In the external replication, it seems that
               students delete more source code characters when they have a
               woman partner, and communicate using more informal utterances,
               reflections and yes/no questions when they have a man partner,
               although these results must be considered inconclusive because of
               the small number of subjects in the replication, and because when
               multiple test corrections are applied, only the result about
               informal utterances remains significant. In any case, more mixed
               methods replications are needed in order to confirm or refute the
               results in the same and other Software Engineering students

               the exam score of students but pays little attention to students'
               daily practice. As an effective method to handle time-series
               dataset, the generalized estimating equations (GEE) have not been
               used in this research field. Considering above issues, we first
               propose an experimental paradigm of programming performance
               analysis based on the performance record of students' daily
               practice-exam and finish collecting a complete time-series

               attributes, learning behavior, and learning performance. Then, we
               propose an approach that analyzes practice-exam time-series

               of gender, students tend to cram for the exam and perform a
               little worse in the daily exercise. Finally, targeting at two

               However, women were disproportionately impacted because women
               were more often in the gender minority. A subsequent audit of the
               university's promotion guidelines suggested a disproportionate
               impact on women's career trajectories. Our framework was guided
               by role congruity theory, which poses that workplace positions
               are gendered by the ratios of men and women who fill them. We
               hypothesized that students would expect educators in a
               department's gender majority to fill more so essential positions
               of teaching upper-level courses and those in the minority to fill
               more so supportive positions of teaching lower-level courses.
               Consistent with role congruity theory when an educator's gender
               violated expected gendered roles, we generally found
               discrimination in the form of lower evaluation scores. A
               follow-up experiment demonstrated that it was possible to change
               students' expectations about which gender would teach their
               courses. When we assigned students randomly to picture themselves
               as students in a male-dominated, female-dominated, or
               gender-parity department, we shifted their expectations of
               whether men or women would teach upper- and lower-level courses.
               Violating students' expectations created negative biases in
               teaching evaluations. This provided a causal link between
               department gender composition and discrimination. The importance
               of gender representation and ameliorating strategies are
               discussed.",

               particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
               subjects. One factor that can contribute to the attrition is the
               lack of visible role models for women in academia. At early
               career stages, the behaviour of the local community may play a
               formative role in identifying ingroup role models, shaping
               women's impressions of whether or not they can be successful in
               academia. One common and formative setting to observe role models
               is the local departmental academic seminar, talk, or
               presentation. We thus quantified women's visibility through the
               question-asking behaviour of academics at seminars using
               observations and an online survey. From the survey responses of
               over 600 academics in 20 countries, we found that women reported
               asking fewer questions after seminars compared to men. This
               impression was supported by observational data from almost 250
               seminars in 10 countries: women audience members asked absolutely
               and proportionally fewer questions than male audience members.
               When asked why they did not ask questions when they wanted to,
               women, more than men, endorsed internal factors (e.g., not
               working up the nerve). However, our observations suggest that
               structural factors might also play a role; when a man was the
               first to ask a question, or there were fewer questions, women
               asked proportionally fewer questions. Attempts to counteract the
               latter effect by manipulating the time for questions (in an
               effort to provoke more questions) in two departments were
               unsuccessful. We propose alternative recommendations for creating
               an environment that makes everyone feel more comfortable to ask
               questions, thus promoting equal visibility for women and members
               of other less visible groups.",

               education. We introduce campus racial climate as a framework for
               conceptualizing the role of racial microaggressions (RMAs) as a
               contributing factor to the lack of representation of domestic
               students of color in STEM programs on college campuses. We
               analyze the experiences of students of color in STEM majors who
               have faced RMAs at the campus, academic, and peer levels. We draw
               from an online survey of more than 4800 students of color
               attending a large public university in the USA. The STEM major
               subsample is made up of 1688 students of color. The study
               estimates a series of Poisson regressions to examine whether
               one’s race, gender, or class year can be used to predict the
               likelihood of the regular occurrence of microaggressions. We also
               use interview data to further understand the challenges faced by
               STEM students of color.ResultsThe quantitative and qualitative
               data suggest that RMAs are not isolated incidents but are
               ingrained in the campus culture, including interactions with STEM
               instructors and advisers and with peers. Students of color
               experience RMAs at all three levels, but Black students in the
               STEM majors are more likely to experience RMAs than other
               students of color in the sample.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates
               the need for campus officials, academic professionals, faculty
               members, and students to work together to address racism at the
               campus, academic, and peer levels. Additionally, STEM departments
               must address the impacts of the larger racial campus culture on
               their classrooms, as well as how departmental culture reinforces
               racial hostility in academic settings. Finally, our findings

               African-American women outside academe. She provides an
               interpretive framework for the work of such prominent Black

               Audre Lorde. The result is a superbly crafted book that provides

               33 studies that were included in our review, they involved 1996
               participants across six countries, over a 25-year period. The
               studies highlighted faculty and staff experiences of ableism in
               academia, which focused on disclosure (i.e., choosing to disclose
               or not), accommodations (i.e., lack of workplace accommodations
               and the difficult process for obtaining them) and negative
               attitudes (i.e., stigma, ableism and exclusion). Twenty-one

               States: the NSHM23 fault sections database (FSD) and earthquake
               geology database (EQGeoDB). In prior iterations of NSHM, fault
               sections were included only if a field-measurement-derived slip
               rate was estimated along a given fault. By expanding this

  abstract  = "Plate tectonics is a particular mode of tectonic activity that
               characterizes the present-day Earth. It is directly linked to not
               only tectonic deformation but also magmatic/volcanic activity and
               all aspects of the rock cycle. Other terrestrial planets in our
               Solar System do not operate in a plate tectonic mode but do have
               volcanic constructs and signs of tectonic deformation. This
               indicates the existence of tectonic modes different from plate
               tectonics. This article discusses the defining features of plate
               tectonics and reviews the range of tectonic modes that have been
               proposed for terrestrial planets to date. A categorization of
               tectonic modes relates to the issue of when plate tectonics
               initiated on Earth as it provides insights into possible
               pre-plate tectonic behaviour. The final focus of this
               contribution relates to transitions between tectonic modes.
               Different transition scenarios are discussed. One follows classic
               ideas of regime transitions in which boundaries between tectonic
               modes are determined by the physical and chemical properties of a
               planet. The other considers the potential that variations in
               temporal evolution can introduce contingencies that have a
               significant effect on tectonic transitions. The latter scenario
               allows for the existence of multiple stable tectonic modes under
               the same physical/chemical conditions. The different transition
               potentials imply different interpretations regarding the type of
               variable that the tectonic mode of a planet represents. Under the
               classic regime transition view, the tectonic mode of a planet is
               a state variable (akin to temperature). Under the multiple stable
               modes view, the tectonic mode of a planet is a process variable.
               That is, something that flows through the system (akin to heat).
               The different implications that follow are discussed as they
               relate to the questions of when did plate tectonics initiate on
               Earth and why does Earth have plate tectonics.This article is
               part of a discussion meeting issue 'Earth dynamics and the
               development of plate tectonics'.",
