title: "RSE: How to"

These module notes aim to provide you with a friendly introduction to *Research Software Engineering* (RSE) or *Research Software Development*. This is an evolution of the course notes [Sustainable Software Development](https://software-dev.streamlit.app/) [@Murphy-Quinlan2024-ba], intended to be more flexible and not reliant on a server.

## Why do software engineering skills matter to researchers?

Research computing competency and specifically programming skills are becoming ever more important in our data-driven world: @Jacobs2016-ex argues that "we are rapidly approaching a point where innovations [in research] will primarily come from those who are able to translate an idea into an algorithm, and then into computer code."

Research software engineering skills are the lab tools and competencies of the computational research world; much like practical lab safety training, researchers often pick up bad habits (ask me about my fear of [HF acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid)). Also similarly to lab processes, procedures, and best practises, software engineering is awash with bizarre jargon and is very difficult to navigate without the support of a jaded old PhD student who has made every mistake imaginable (hello, it's me, I escaped my PhD over a year ago now).

This course does not provide **the holy grail**, the singular **correct way** of doing things; instead, it should hopefully make the process of writing good, robust, reproducible code a little bit more straighforward.

This course consists of a series of different topics and notes, usually including a brief presentation and some exercises for you to follow along with. Where relevant, I've cited various articles, and have usually linked to a variety of different resources.

## How to use this resource

1. Use the PRIMM method where possible

The PRIMM method is a method to specifically learn a programming language [@Sentance2019-on], but is generally useful for learning computational commands etc.
